Terry,"JP, update on the Morgenthau murder?"
Charles,I think it was flan.
Rosa,Maybe it was just old person gunk. You know how old people always have that gunk on them.
Terry,How about we focus on the murder and not the old person gunk?
Terry,"Okay, I want you on this. It's gonna be priority one for the new C.O."
Rosa,"Wait, tell us about the new Captain."
Terry,Captain Holt will be here soon. He'll wanna introduce himself. Dismissed.
Charles,"Hey, Gina. You know any scalpers? I wanna ask Rosa to go to the Rihanna concert with me, but it's sold out."
Charles,Yeah. What's your second point?
Charles,"Yeah, that was my ex-wife's type too."
Charles,Cool. Where would I find a place that shows old movies?
Charles,Great.
Charles,Thank you.
Rosa,And go!
Terry,"Yes, sir."
Terry,"Fatter, sir. They called me ""Terry tіttіеs."" Because I had large, uh..."
Terry,"A year ago, my wife and I had twin baby girls. Cagney and Lacey."
Terry,"Ever since, I kinda got scared of getting hurt. Lost my edge. There was an incident in a department store."
Terry,I’m fine. I'm fine.
Terry,And I'm still not right.
Terry,"Now the good ones. Rosa Diaz. Tough, smart, hard to read, and really scary."
Rosa,Tell me who has me for Secret Santa.
Rosa,"Yes, you will."
Terry,"Charles Boyle. He's a grinder. Not the most brilliant detective, but he works harder than anyone else. He's not physically… gifted."
Charles,"Oh, man! My muffin. Ahh! Oh, my head! My muffin, my head! And I stepped on the... On my muffin! And my head and my muffin."
Terry,"Amy Santiago. She's got seven brothers, so she's always trying to prove she's tough."
Terry,"She and Peralta have some big bet over who gets more arrests this year. Ever since the bet, their numbers have gone way up."
Terry,Jacob Peralta is my best detective. He likes putting away bad guys and he loves solving puzzles. The only puzzle he hasn't solved is how to grow up.
Terry,I’ve talked a lot about Jake in my departmentally mandated therapy sessions.
Terry,"Absolutely, sir. Where do we start?"
Charles,"Hey, that's mine. You took it from my desk."
Charles,Thanks!
Charles,"Yeah, he's a little too serious. What do you think, Rosa?"
Rosa,He seems cool.
Charles,"Yeah, he seems cool. I agree."
Rosa,"Looks like the perp stole a computer, a watch, and a Jamon lberico ham, valued at... what! $6,000."
Charles,"Jamon lberico is an amazing cured ham from Spain. They had it at my uncle's funeral. I gorged myself at that funeral. I mean, I was constipated for three days."
Charles,"Hey, Rosa! Rosa. Rosa! Um, I just happened to notice that there's an old movie festival playing at the film forum this week. Wanna go?"
Rosa,Sure.
Charles,Cool! Awesome. There's a bunch of movie options. I'll probably just go with something classic like Citizen Kane.
Rosa,Citizen Kane is terrible. Pick a good movie.
Charles,Good call. Smart. I'll do it. I'll pick a better movie than Citizen Kane.
Charles,"No surprises from the coroner. A few gunshots, shoulder and chest."
Charles,Mm-hmm.
Charles,Yep.
Charles,Jamon lberico.
Charles,Beneficio's might.
Charles,You gotta brief the C.O. first.
Charles,Great idea.
Charles,"Oh! I'm Henry Morgenthau, owner of delicious and expensive hams. Don't I know you from the grocery store?"
Charles,On it!
Charles,"Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, Ratko!"
Charles,That's a waste of manchego!
Terry,"You're lucky, man. I wish I could get assigned here full-time. You could not be farther from the action."
Terry,"You're wrong about Holt. That man has forgotten more about being a cop than you will ever know. In 1981, he caught the Disco Strangler."
Terry,The man is the real deal. You need to listen to him.
Rosa,So what movie did you get us tickets to?
Charles,"Oh, well, just to be safe, I bought tickets to all of them."
Rosa,Just to be safe? What does that mean?
Charles,"I don't know, I didn't wanna mess up. Because you're sort of... Opinionated."
Rosa,"You think I'm opinionated? Okay, here's an opinion for you. You're a bad judge of character and your shirt looks like vomit."
Charles,So we can go see North by Northwest.
Rosa,We're not seeing a movie together.
Charles,Good call. Smart. Keep it profesh.
Rosa,"Yeah, nice!"
Rosa,Here. I feel bad that you spent all that money on the movie tickets.
Charles,Why don't you just go to the movies with me?
Rosa,Nope.
Charles,"Okay. Well, this is awkward."
Rosa,It's not awkward. I like your company. You're sweet.
Rosa,Hands behind your back! Hands behind your back!
Charles,Stay down.
Terry,"Okay, detectives, let's get started. Santiago, where are we with the Jay Street drug bust?"
Terry,Good. Take Boyle and Diaz.
Charles,Dream team.
Terry,"Peralta, brief us on the vandalism case."
Terry,He can clearly spot 'em. You should take my minivan.
Rosa,A minivan? A-ha!
Terry,You all got a problem with my minivan?
Terry,"‘Cause my wife doesn't like it either. She wanted an SUV, but those things roll, man. They roll!"
Rosa,Babysitting. Ha-ha!
Charles,"Oh, look at this. The drug dealer got a B.A. in art history from Brooklyn college. Interesting, huh?"
Rosa,How's that interesting?
Charles,"Well, it's surprising because you would think he had studied... drugs."
Rosa,Also not interesting.
Rosa,"Ugh. Really, Gina? A psychic?"
Rosa,"Thank you, Carlene. Your entire life is garbage."
Terry,You made a mixtape?
Terry,"What's insane is how you refuse to get with the program. There is a new sheriff in town, Jake."
Terry,Did he let you play your mixtape?
Terry,"Get an iPod, man. Mixtape?"
Charles,"I just want to apologize for my fellow detectives’ behavior. Okay, my granny also had the gift."
Charles,She was right. She died two years later.
Charles,Rosa. Yes?
Charles,Thank you.
Terry,"What are you doing, Peralta?"
Terry,What? There's a penis on my minivan?
Rosa,You know what they don't teach you at the academy? It's better to be a criminal.
Charles,"Oh, no. The cabinets are blue."
Charles,The psychic predicted the drugs would be found in something blue.
Charles,She also made this really depressing prediction about my life.
Charles,"And if she's right about where we find the drugs, that means she's right about the other thing."
Rosa,Where was it?
Charles,What color was the hamper?
Charles,Yes. The clothes hamper was green. The clothes hamper was green! Drinks on me.
Charles,"I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but your psychic friend's predictions about the drug case were wrong, which means all of her predictions are wrong."
Charles,We found the cocaine behind a green hamper. Never said “green” or the letter H.
Charles,Lady bin?
Terry,"Baby, I've got some bad news. Someone painted a giant penis on our minivan. No, you cannot have an SUV now. Those things roll, baby. They roll!"
Rosa,So what are you doing tonight?
Charles,Nothing. What about you... are doing tonight?
Rosa,Nothing.
Charles,"Man, you were totally right about the cocaine, and you were also right about Rosa."
Charles,The woman I-
Charles,"Yes, that woman."
Charles,"Oh, my god."
Rosa,"Don’t arrest him. Just smack him. Hard. With a phone book on a body part no one can see, you know what I’m saying?"
Rosa,"Ha, ha, I guess so, yeah. Why?"
Charles,"I don’t know, man. I’m lost. The universe is a cruel and vexing puzzle. I-I’m at the whim of the cosmos."
Charles,Choo. Yes.
Rosa,What’s up with the chair?
Charles,"Um, Carlene predicted if I get out of this chair, I’d get badly hurt, so I’m not chancing it. Oh, man. There’s no more pudding cups left. Ah! What’d you do that for?"
Rosa,"There. Now you’re hurt in this chair. You can get hurt anywhere, Boyle. And if you do, it won’t be because some shoe salesman predicted it. You make your own destiny."
Charles,"Carlene was wrong, Gina. Rosa said it herself-- I’m in charge of my own destiny. That means she wants me to make a move."
Charles,"No, no, she punched me to prove Carlene wrong."
Rosa,Move.
Charles,"I know, it’s crazy."
Charles,"I like Turner & Hooch. Tom Hanks, reluctant friendship with a dog. That hits me where I live."
Rosa,No. Robocop. It's got everything Ike--gratuitous violence.
Rosa,I was. I'm done.
Terry,Francois Truffaut's Breathless. What? Terry likes foreign films.
Charles,"Well, we shall see what we shall see."
Charles,Damn it! This is Jeffrey Dahmer's corduroys all over again.
Terry,"All right, let's get started. Scully. Where are you on digitizing the old case files?"
Terry,Why are you smiling? That's nothin’.
Rosa,At least you get to sit on your butt all day.
Terry,Dismissed.
Charles,"Hey, Sarge, I need someone to fill out a lineup. Will you be Scary Terry?"
Terry,"Oh, I love being Scary Terry. He says what regular Terry's thinking."
Terry,This is takin' too long! I'm gonna miss the farmer's market!
Terry,"But I'm too busy. I've got a special case I'm working on. Uh, Hitchcock, Boyle needs you to fill out a lineup."
Charles,No one asked you to take your shirt off. Stop volunteering to take your shirt off.
Rosa,What do you need?
Rosa,That thing where we try to get a bunch of loser kids to become student snitches?
Rosa,Losers.
Rosa,Snitches. What about it?
Rosa,Now I gotta read something?
Charles,I'm- I'm not really her husband.
Charles,"Okay, this is Ethel Musterberg from the Prospect Heights Senior Center. There was an I.D. card in her back pocket."
Terry,Why was your hand in her back pocket?
Charles,Frisked! I frisked her butt!
Rosa,You asked us to come in here.
Charles,"Well, I haven't really been in a slump since my divorce. So I'd tell this person, ""Maybe get divorced."" He'd have to get married first."
Rosa,"Fly to Montreal, hit a classy hotel bar, bone a stranger, slump over."
Rosa,Yeah.
Terry,"10,000 sit-ups."
Charles,We're helping Jake's friend get out of his slump.
Terry,"He's right. You just need a win. Pick your easiest, no-brainer case, and work it till it's done."
Rosa,Yeah.
Rosa,"Nah, I think I'm good."
Terry,Don't make me hit you again.
Terry,Um...I'm building this dollhouse for my girls. It's their birthday tomorrow. I told my wife I'd get it done.
Charles,I had the same exact one when I was a kid!
Charles,"You want some help, big man?"
Terry,"No! I can do this. It's just driving me a little crazy. Where do I affix the princess tower, Boyle?! Where do I affix it?!"
Charles,On the side of the turret-
Terry,"Not now, Boyle. Let a brother breathe. Let a brother breathe."
Charles,"Hey, slump, you're about to get nailed by the Jake Hammer."
Charles,"No, you are not, Jake Rabbit."
Rosa,"They don't identify with you because you're not from the streets. I am. Follow, watch, learn. All right, listen up. I know you think you're badasses. But deep down, you're scared. How do I know? Because I've been that same scared kid, and if you don't get your crap together, I'm gonna end up busting you and throwing you in jail. Got it?"
Rosa,What's happening?
Rosa,That's never happened before. I don't like it.
Charles,Apartment's clear.
Charles,"Oh, bird pooped on your shoulder. No, wait... Pooped on your head, then dripped onto your shoulder."
Charles,"I'm telling you, it's good luck."
Charles,You could eat off his shirt.
Charles,Man... Girls are so scary.
Charles,"Could be a year. Could be a decade. Sorry, we're just saying bigger and bigger numbers."
Rosa,"In this case, not being a cop might actually be better."
Charles,You okay?
Charles,Hey. What's going on?
Charles,So what you're saying is that this is kind of a...
Charles,You know I will.
Charles,"I'm just saying, put a couple leather chairs in here."
Rosa,You did this program?
Charles,They're here.
Charles,No.
Charles,Blammo! Jake Hammer strikes again.
Charles,"Hey, Sarge. I assembled the castle for you. Here it is."
Terry,"Oh, my God. What happened to all the princess flourishes?"
Charles,"Well, they were destroyed, so I turned it into a princess police station. You know, some jobs take brains, some jobs take muscles, some jobs take dainty little fingers. Did I ever tell you I had to wear a woman's wedding ring?"
Terry,"Thank you, Boyle. I appreciate it."
Charles,"You're a good dad. Don't put so much pressure on yourself. Oh, check this out. Working siren."
Rosa,"My oldest collar was 78, but the PCP made her fight like she was 20."
Charles,You talking oldest bags? 68.
Charles,"Yeah, but I was only 20."
Charles,"No, man, it was before I got into the academy."
Rosa,Charles isn't talking about his oldest arrest.
Charles,"No... yes, I am. Yeah, oldest arrest... 68, like I said."
Charles,"You know how it is. When you have a chance to bed an older woman, you..."
Charles,"She was, actually. That's how I met her. Went to college with her grandson Marvin. Don't... don't knock it till you try it. She had a replacement hip with some serious torque. It was like having sex with a transformer."
Terry,Peralta... Where are we on the Lincoln place murder?
Terry,"Yes, Jake. I played linebacker at Syracuse."
Charles,"Really? In High School, I played center field in the musical damn Yankees."
Charles,Nice.
Rosa,"Come on, Peralta, Holt said to use the whole team. We all want this solved."
Charles,Yeah!
Charles,I would never steal his thunder. I-I'd be afraid to borrow it.
Terry,You mean drive you there and wait outside... Far away from the guns.
Terry,"Sir, I haven't fired a weapon since the incident."
Terry,"Actually, there was an incident after that."
Terry,Screaming shooting the piñata.
Terry,"Sir, I may not be the man for the job."
Charles,"Oh, boy."
Charles,Come on!
Rosa,"Yo, I looked at the photos of your victim on your desk."
Charles,Is that Rosa? Tell her I said hi.
Rosa,"The puncture wounds are similar to a case I had a while back. They aren't from a knife. I think it's something spiral, like a corkscrew."
Rosa,Don't shush me. I'm helping you.
Rosa,Uh-oh. You better get back here. Now.
Charles,What's up?
Charles,"Yeah, I feel sexy."
Charles,You know I do.
Charles,We call him The Vulture because he swoops in and solves cases that are almost solved and takes the credit for himself.
Charles,"Sir, call him The Vulture. Giving him a name makes him human."
Charles,"Yeah, she did... Murder on lce, Recipe for Murder. Nancy was a wonderful Detective. I wanted to be her when I grew up."
Rosa,That's because it was 98% solved.
Rosa,Me too. But he's kind of hot.
Rosa,"What? You can hate people and still think they're hot. Case in point, Manuel Noriega."
Rosa,"Yeah, she's thick."
Rosa,Sorry you got vultured. Happens to the best of us.
Rosa,"On my count. One, two..."
Charles,Yes.
Charles,I used a gift card for that!
Rosa,Or slash his gorgeous throat.
Charles,I cannot figure you out.
Charles,"What if you called him from a hospital and said his whole family is dead? Like, they died of cancer."
Terry,All right. Back your left foot up a hair.
Terry,No! Gina! We've been over this.
Terry,"All right, look, hands here, stand up straight, chin forward."
Terry,Gina!
Terry,"Yeah, everybody does stances, Gina. Listen, uh... Hey, all right, all right! Look, hey, both you, just watch."
Terry,Why are you counting my shots? Are you trying to have me recertified?
Terry,I can't believe you tricked me!
Charles,What if we wrap his motorcycle in plastic wrap and melt it with a hair dryer? Little trick I learned in gift basket making class.
Charles,You're welcome.
Rosa,He seems like he would.
Charles,Yeah! Winning by default!
Rosa,"On third, right near here. How do you know that?"
Rosa,What?
Terry,I just need a second.
Charles,Come on!
Charles,I love the bus!
Rosa,Hitchcock farts nonstop.
Terry,It's just the target looks exactly like a friend of mine. It's just freaking me out.
Terry,"Yes. Let's all just count to a million. One, two, three, four, five, six... So then lceman says, ""You can be my wingman any day."" And then Maverick says..."
Terry,I know!
Charles,I'm always the victim. I don't want to be the victim.
Charles,No. I'll be the victim. Don't make me a door again.
Rosa,She dumps it in the hallway trash chute on the way to the doorman.
Rosa,"Stab! Then I... Toss the corkscrew out the window, and it lands on a passing car."
Charles,Right.
Charles,Wow!
Charles,"No! I have broad shoulders. I have narrow hips, but broad shoulders. God!"
Charles,A little lower.
Charles,Broad shoulders! Stuck! Told you... Broad shoulders.
Charles,Voila!
Terry,Peralta! Now.
Terry,"Shut it! Holt was right. I've been so worried about my own kids, I forgot about my stupid grown-up kids."
Terry,"I should've been on you guys more. And starting now, I will be. But if you ever do this again, I swear I will crush your head in one hand."
Terry,Try me.
Terry,The boss is taking heat for something that's not even his fault. I can't let that happen.
Terry,Sir? Thank you.
Terry,"It's gonna be a long road, but I'm ready to get myself back in the game."
Terry,"I mean, eventually... Not tonight. I need to go hug my baby girls. Excuse me."
Charles,"Jake, I have to say, the way you handled things with The Vulture yesterday was very mature."
Charles,Can't wait to see it.
Charles,Yeah!
Charles,I'm Mario Batali.
Charles,"Santiago, I know that you hate Halloween, but stick with me, and I promise you, you will love it."
Charles,"Yeah, you would. You'd be an evil mastermind, and everyone would call you the handsome bandit."
Rosa,Can't tell you how many nuns I wanted to beat up in catholic school. Ten.
Terry,I didn't know you went to catholic schooL
Rosa,Good. You shouldn't know it.
Terry,I get it. You're so mysterious and tough. But you know what I think? You're actually a big softy.
Terry,You probably read a Maya Angelou poem at your graduation and cried.
Rosa,Didn't graduate. Had to leave.
Terry,Why? What'd you do?
Rosa,Here's a hint. I'm not gonna tell you.
Terry,"Oh, I'm gonna find out anyway."
Terry,I'm a Detective. I will detect!
Charles,"Okay, party's around the corner. Tipster said there'll be a huge amount of drug activity."
Charles,"The department never washes them, so it's probably vomit. Hey! I got you a chocolate. Yet another great thing about Halloween... chocolate!"
Charles,"So great. We're having the best time. Right, Amy?"
Rosa,"If you wanted to make a bet with Holt, you shoulda made a bet you could win. Like who wears more denim jackets."
Charles,"You're the best, Jake."
Charles,"Jake, you're the best."
Terry,"Look, Jake, I love you like you're one of my daughters."
Terry,But it's not about you or how smart you are. It's about Captain Holt. The man's a genius. He's had your number at every turn.
Rosa,"Okay, here's the first set of royal babies I rounded up. Popular costume. Any of these guys look familiar?"
Rosa,"Number three, step forward and say, ""give me your money, you stupid bag of crap."""
Terry,I still want to know why you got kicked out of catholic school. Were you doing drugs?
Rosa,Worse.
Terry,Selling drugs?
Rosa,Worse.
Terry,How bad could it have been? Did you burn down a church?
Rosa,"Number three, step forward and say the word ""worse."""
Charles,"Come on, Amy! Loosen up! You look like such a cop! Come on, have some fun, you know? It'll help you blend in! Whoo!"
Charles,I'm backing it up.
Charles,"Ooh, when you were logging in the drugs, you missed some awesome stuff. Guy walked by in full astronaut costume, gave me a high five."
Charles,Wait... Hitchcock?
Charles,What is happening?
Charles,Really?
Charles,You paid money to get out of working with me?
Charles,"No, all the things that you think are bad about Halloween are what make it great. The big kids egg you. Then you and your friends run away together. Friendships are forged in the crucible of Halloween adversity. That's all I wanted for us. You can keep the wig. I don't need it anymore."
Rosa,I remember that old bag. She was my favorite.
Terry,"Well, guess what she said. Apparently, you were a model student and transferred of your own volition."
Rosa,Fine. The reason I left catholic school was because I got into the American ballet academy. I was a classical dancer. And I was good.
Terry,I knew it! I knew you were a big softy.
Rosa,"You tell anyone, I break your face. {ROSA CLOSES HER DRAWER WITH HER FOOT}"
Charles,"Well, Captain, it seems that Jake isn't the only person you underestima..."
Charles,"In fact, the thing that you failed to see, Captain, teamwork, is exactly..."
Charles,What provided our success.
Terry,"Boyle, I need you in the briefing room."
Charles,What is all this?
Charles,I'm sorry I couldn't convince you to love Halloween.
Charles,"'Stume! Oh, my God. It caught on."
Rosa,Officer in the 92nd got the royal baby mugger. He had 19 wallets in his diaper.
Terry,Damn!
Rosa,"Oh, I didn't tell you. I got kicked out of ballet school for beating the crap out of ballerinas."
Rosa,What's up with this emergency meeting?
Terry,"Whoa, Detective Santiago."
Rosa,"Hey, is this why you were getting makeup tips from the prostitute in the holding cell?"
Charles,"Way to go, Jakey."
Terry,I'm not tired. Why would you think I was tired?
Terry,"I ended up doing 25 minutes of sleep chin-ups on muscle memory alone. Tired Terry still gets after it, that's all I'm saying."
Rosa,"Hey, Gina, can you order food for us at the Flatbush Diner? They make the best pies in New York City."
Rosa,Wrong. Ignorant and wrong.
Rosa,"Boyle, you're always blogging on that foodie website. Which pie's better?"
Charles,"Oh, uh, you know, I-I haven't been to either place yet."
Charles,(scoffs) Wouldn't you like to know?
Charles,"What? (laughs nervously) That is not true, okay? I-I-I don't even like food."
Charles,Who's Rosa? Y-you're the scared one.
Charles,How long were we asleep?
Terry,"Just long enough for me to squeeze in quick workout. So, like, three hours."
Rosa,Morning.
Rosa,You people already know too much about me.
Rosa,Is that a nightgown?
Terry,That's mine. It's a t-shirt from my fat phase.
Terry,"When you're that big, you buy anything that fits. A lot of fat guy clothes have racist overtones."
Rosa,"Hey, if Jake says the guy did it, that usually means the guy did it."
Rosa,"No, I'm still furious at you."
Charles,Kitchen buds.
Rosa,Where's he taking you?
Charles,"I think the perfect first date doesn't feel like a first date at all, because you've known each other for a few years, maybe even work together. And one night you're laughing, and then all of a sudden, it's just like blammo! Kissing."
Rosa,"For me: Cheap dinner, watch basketball, bone down."
Charles,So pretty much the same as what I said.
Rosa,"None of the partials match Whitman. If he did it, he didn't leave any prints."
Charles,Maybe he doesn't have any. Interesting fact about me... I once burnt my fingerprints off on a wok.
Charles,What are you doing? Holt said you didn't have to come in here. You don't come in on days you're supposed to work.
Charles,So fun.
Terry,"You got a second, Captain? I've got these overtime forms for you to s..."
Terry,"No, sir."
Terry,"I'm fine. And I filled this out. I just need you to... Permission to yawn, sir."
Charles,It's all right. 6 out of 12.
Charles,"For the 12 components of food satisfaction: Salty, sweet, sour, bitter, umami, odor, sound..."
Charles,"Oh, wow. That's the best pie I ever had."
Rosa,(laughs)
Terry,What's this?
Charles,We were running calls to pawn shops and then waiting for them to call back.
Terry,I didn't ask what you were doing. I asked what you are doing.
Rosa,"Pie taste test, it's over. I won."
Terry,"That's unacceptable. If you wanna know which restaurant has better pies, you can't just have one guy try one pie from each place. Everybody needs to try all the pies from both places. We gonna be here awhile."
Terry,Another one for Crust. It's not looking good for Flatbush Diner.
Rosa,"Ah, come on!"
Charles,I'm just glad I keep a toothbrush here.
Charles,"Uh, why do you wanna borrow the toothbrush?"
Charles,"Jake, it's been in my mouth."
Terry,Bring out the meringues.
Terry,"You wanted something, sir?"
Terry,"Sir, this is not necessary. Also, can't sleep without my whale songs."
Terry,"Everything's great with my wife. It's just, my brother-in-law's in town, and we do not get along. He thinks I'm a weakling."
Terry,I can do it.
Terry,He makes me feel so small.
Charles,You're everyone's secretary. That's literally your job.
Charles,(sighs) I'm sorry about the whole pie blowup thing. You're right. The Flatbush Diner pie is awful.
Charles,It's just... I want Rosa to like me.
Terry,This is such a disaster.
Terry,"No, not that. My brother-in-law is coming to have dinner with me on his way to JFK. But also the botched investigation, that's bad too."
Rosa,Good.
Charles,"Hey, Rosa, the Flatbush Diner's pie is terrible. It's inedible. Food is supposed to be edible."
Rosa,"So you were lying? What the hell, Boyle?"
Charles,"Crust isn't any better. It's fancier, but it's all bells and whistles. Desserts don't need to be clever. They just need to be good. This is the best pie in New York City... Apple from Argos Bakery, founded 1910. Recipe unchanged. Taste it."
Rosa,"Damn, it is amazing."
Charles,"You just graduated pie school, bitches. Sorry I said ""bitches,"" I'm just really worked up."
Rosa,{laughs)
Terry,So this is my desk.
Terry,"Actually, I don't like pickles that much."
Terry,Oh?
Terry,"So you want me first through the door, sir?"
Terry,"Hey, I'm not gonna be able to make dinner tonight."
Terry,"Thank you, sir. I'll never forget it."
Rosa,"You only get one shot at this, Peralta."
Rosa,How much time do we have?
Charles,I have an idea...
Rosa,Why do you care so much about some old reporter?
Rosa,No. And no one has ever thought that.
Charles,Nice. (Holding coffee)
Terry,All right. Everyone's here. Today we're gonna work on our courtroom demeanor.
Rosa,Pass.
Terry,"This seminar is not optional, Diaz. You're testifying in an aggravated assault case tomorrow. The D.A. is worried about how you present yourself on the stand."
Rosa,Why? I'm fine on the stand.
Rosa,I'm sorry... can you make her stop doing that weird thing with her face?
Rosa,"And when this is over, I'm gonna find you, and I'm gonna break those little fingers."
Terry,This is an important case. You need to do well.
Rosa,Fine. I'll take your dumbass seminar.
Charles,That's the spirit!
Terry,"All you need is for a jury to like you. If they like you, they'll trust you."
Rosa,Fine. How do I get these morons to like me?
Terry,Don't call them morons.
Terry,Good instinct!
Charles,"Okay. Sit up straight, all right? Be aware of your hands, okay? And don't be afraid to smile. And if you need to buy time, you can always just say, ""to be perfectly candid..."""
Rosa,To be perfectly candid... I like that.
Terry,And always make good eye contact.
Charles,But don't stare at people.
Terry,Yeah. You gotta blink.
Charles,But don't blink too much.
Terry,Or too fast.
Charles,I think the bigger worry is slow blinks.
Terry,Don't blink too fast or too slow or too much or too little.
Rosa,I know how to blink.
Rosa,Why are we meeting in the ladies' room?
Terry,It's the perfect place for our second lesson... Courthouse wardrobe.
Rosa,What's wrong with the way I dress?
Charles,"You know, some people might say that all the black leather kind of makes you looks like an evil villain. Not me. I think you look like a sexy motorcycle."
Terry,"Boyle, pull it together."
Charles,Yeah.
Terry,We need to soften up your look. My wife and Charles's mom donated some clothes.
Rosa,Your wife and Boyle's mom are both blind?
Rosa,I look like arsenio.
Charles,So it's... perfect?
Charles,That's actually my wedding suit.
Rosa,No.
Rosa,Yes.
Charles,No.
Terry,No.
Terry,That's great.
Charles,Perfect! You look beautiful... ly... Appropriate for court.
Charles,This is not good. The lawyer is that slimeball grundhaven... Rosa hates him!
Terry,She's dressed right. We coached her. She'll be okay.
Rosa,To be perfectly candid... My name is Detective Rosa Diaz.
Rosa,I caught Mr. Ladd physically beating his boss with a fax machine. Most of his cheek was caved in. His head was basically a blood fountain.
Rosa,"Great advice, dummies. I look like a psycho up there!"
Charles,Yes. You have to pull it together.
Rosa,That's not helping!
Charles,"That's what sarge says to me when I'm nervous. Rosa, I think you're nervous."
Rosa,Of course I'm nervous! What did you think was the problem?
Terry,We just assumed you were a terrifying human being with a short fuse.
Charles,"But if the problem is that you're nervous, that's where Charles Boyle lives, baby. I can help! You just need to go to your happy place."
Rosa,What's that? Sounds stupid.
Rosa,Great! Now I'm starving!
Rosa,"To be perfectly candid, I was pretty sure it was the defendant."
Rosa,I think I know what happened.
Rosa,Your client instigated the fight. I'm certain. And I'm happy to tell you why.
Charles,She went to her happy place.
Terry,"I know that, Boyle."
Charles,Here she is.
Terry,"Diaz, you did it. They found him guilty on all charges."
Rosa,Huh. Boyle's advice worked.
Rosa,"I'm in a cabin in the middle of nowhere. Inside it's just me and that stupid, slimy defense attorney."
Terry,Yeah. Okay. I'm gonna go ahead and schedule you for a psych eval.
Rosa,"I owe you one, Boyle. Thank-you dinner. Tomorrow night. Gribaldi's. It's all-you-can-eat linguini."
Charles,Yes!
Rosa,"Oh, my boyfriend's coming too."
Charles,Your what friend now?
Terry,What are you talking about?
Terry,I was working out and saw a muscle in my shoulder I'd never seen before. I thought it might've been a scientific discovery.
Charles,"Yes, I did, and I am thrilled with the results. Although the jar is really hot."
Rosa,You're not a genie.
Charles,"Why do we want to start a turf war with the fire department? I feel very uncomfortable saying this to you, but it doesn't seem like it's worth it... Unless you think it is."
Charles,"I'm sorry, Jake, Sal's is only the eighth-best. I put out a weekly Brooklyn pizza-ranking email blast. Sal's has the fourth-best texture, ninth-best crust, twelfth-best cheese, and honestly, they're only seventh in mouth-feel."
Charles,"The inside of your cheeks are very sensitive. It's like the inside of your thighs, except with a tongue."
Terry,"Captain, here's the mope who hacked our computer system. His mother turned him in. His name is Corey Park."
Terry,"His web handle is ""savant."" His people name is Corey Park."
Terry,Why are you giving candy to a baby in the first place? Don't give candy to a baby! They can't brush their teeth!
Terry,I doubt I'll need Gina's help. I'm sure she's busy anyway.
Terry,"Man, don't be hacking into my stuff."
Charles,"Uh-oh, Jake, firemen."
Charles,"Mario is number ten overall in Brooklyn, and rising fast. He might've wanted to move up the ladder."
Charles,Yeah.
Charles,It'll be the perfect opportunity to update my rankings. Can we stop at home for a pizza bib?
Charles,I'll just use my work bib.
Rosa,"The guy who did the safe in the second apartment, what was his name?"
Rosa,What?
Rosa,"Yeah, I know how to spell cone."
Rosa,Nope.
Rosa,Nope.
Rosa,You have a problem with me that you want to talk about?
Charles,"In a word, yes. Amateurs go tasting, they fill up, and they lose their palate by the third slice. I take this very seriously."
Charles,Gino... This pizza is much better than last time. You've always ranked dead last in structural integrity and sauce.
Charles,Can't. Firemen locked it down.
Terry,"Ah, you must be Simon Walker. Have a seat. It says here you were an I.T. Specialist with the board of ed for two years."
Terry,I'm sorry about her. Okay. What's your experience with cyber-security?
Terry,There's no need to be nervous.
Terry,What would you say is your biggest weakness as an employee?
Rosa,Here's an itemized list of everything taken from the garden apartment.
Rosa,"Oh, my God, enough."
Rosa,"That's it. Get in my car, now. And if you say another word, I promise you, you will regret it."
Charles,"Ooh, undercover work. I love it. I need more back story. First off, can it be my daughter's cat?"
Charles,"Fine. Let's talk about the cat. Short-hair, long-hair? Tabby?"
Charles,"Oh, that's brutal."
Charles,"I like it. Hey, guys? Guys, I really need your help. My little boy, Brian, my angel, I bought him a short-haired calico after my wife fell into a coma... Motorcycle crash. And now the cat's stuck in a tree."
Charles,He's a cute kid. Kinda looks like you. Handsome guy. Handsome little guy.
Charles,"Brian was adopted, so he has abandonment issues. Just struck out at tee-ball last week. Everyone called him ""cryin' Brian."""
Charles,"They're getting nervous, Jake! They're getting nervous!"
Charles,"Get off him, Boone! You big marshmallow!"
Charles,Well...
Charles,Captain reads my blast.
Charles,I'm coming in.
Rosa,"I thought about it, but then I put that thought on hold. I wanted to show you Ropesburg."
Rosa,"You wanted this offer so badly, I thought I'd give you a chance at the job."
Rosa,"Hi, sergeant. No, I'm still not interested. At all. But this is Detective Santiago. She's one of our top detectives, and she really wants the job."
Rosa,"He quit to start a carpet cleaning business, because that was better than being Captain here because this is the most boring place on earth."
Terry,"Fine, what about this guy?"
Rosa,I'll pay for that.
Terry,"Fine, what was with the flossing?"
Terry,That punk who hacked us?
Terry,But how can we be sure he won't turn on us?
Charles,Uh-huh. My turn?
Charles,"The crust was charred, the cheese was stringy and flavorless, but the sauce. Oh, Marone, the sauce. Continue."
Rosa,So what'd you think of Ropesburg?
Rosa,"It's whack, and you know it. Their number-one crime is tricycle theft. There's a bakery attached to the precinct. Come on, Santiago. You never would've taken that job, so why'd you even care that they offered it to me?"
Rosa,"Well, you're not the only girl at the table anymore. We work in a police force full of dudes. We gotta have each other's backs, okay?"
Rosa,"Yeah, I got your back. Don't smile. I'm still mad at you."
Rosa,Moment's over. Shut up.
Terry,"Savant, you're part of the nine-nine now. We look after each other. Hey, ball, if savant was to do anything to harm this precinct, would I destroy him? (Terry crushes the 8 ball with his hand, Charles eyes are widen) Answer uncertain. Try again."
Charles,Fire! Fire! Fire!
Charles,Happy Turkey Day.
Charles,What? What's going on?
Charles,All the girls were too big.
Charles,"Well, now that I know you want me to say that, I'll just say it with two gobbles. Gobble, gobble... Gobble. God, it just sounds right that way. Ugh. I don't like this game."
Rosa,"Ha! ""Boyle objects to Boyle Bingo."""
Charles,"Come on, guys."
Terry,"Boyle says, ""Come on, guys."" That's two for Terry."
Charles,"Well, guess what. I can spoil your little game by sitting over here quietly all day and doing nothing. (Takes a seat and falls on floor) Oh! Aah!"
Charles,That's a victory. That's a victory for Boyle. Boom!
Rosa,It's the one without any blood on it.
Terry,"Damn it, Boyle. You left the fridge open. The door couldn't shut because of your empty pizza box.(Takes out the pizza box)"
Charles,Pizza? Please. This is a butternut squash and truffle butter flatbread.
Terry,"Everything's spoiled. My lunch is ruined. My chicken, my potatoes, my pasta, my meatballs, ham, my yogurt. (Takes out every meal)"
Charles,"Wow, that's a lot of yogurt."
Terry,I love yogurt.
Charles,"So this is your lunch for, like, the month?"
Terry,"I need to eat 10,000 calories a day to maintain muscle mass. My wife made me all of this before she left town with the kids. That was everything in my fridge. (Closes fridge door)"
Terry,Scully.
Terry,Where is it?
Terry,Is it in your pockets?
Terry,I'm gonna shake it out of your pockets. Turn around.
Terry,Release your sweets.
Rosa,"It looks like you live on the set of Murder, She Wrote."
Terry,"Hey, excuse me. Can we please eat? My body is starting to digest itself. Terry needs nutrients."
Rosa,Don't apologize. I'd rather spend Thanksgiving at your house than with my sister.
Rosa,Yay.
Rosa,"It's so pleasant and boring. But, Holt, at your house, surrounded by these idiots? Guaranteed train wreck. Thanks for the invite. (Smiles)"
Terry,"No waiting, just toasting. I want you to toast. Now I wanna eat toast. Give me some toast!"
Charles,Hang on. I have a toast. (Stands up) I am thankful to have someone in my life who gives me a reason to get out of bed every morning. And I hope that my relationship with this person will only grow more intimate.
Charles,"Um, Hitchcock."
Terry,Why wouldn't you? They're both white powders. Of course they're interchangeable.
Terry,Can't. I'm so stuffed.
Terry,Toilet.
Terry,I ate one string bean. It tasted like fish vomit. That was it for me.
Charles,I'm a textbook people-pleaser. I have a serious problem. This was great though. You must be so proud.
Charles,"I-I'm not done hanging out. Let's go to the bar, they serve food there. That's a great idea."
Rosa,"Oh, look at that. ""Boyle saves Thanksgiving."""
Charles,Does it really say that?
Rosa,"No. But it does say, ""Boyle believes obvious lie."""
Charles,Damn it.
Charles,"Tommy, can we order some food?"
Terry,Do you have any more of these pretzels?
Charles,Smart. Good call.
Rosa,Please do.
Terry,But the cook is coming back.
Charles,There is nothing here.
Terry,"Don't worry, guys, I found food. (Sets a box down and eat the packing peanuts)"
Rosa,Are you eating packing peanuts?
Charles,"Sarge, am I too heavy?"
Terry,No. Where is it?
Terry,There's a lot of food up there?
Terry,You think?
Charles,"No, this will not be our Thanksgiving. All right, you all wait here. Give me an hour. Terry, to the door."
Terry,"I'm just gonna put you down, man."
Charles,"Yeah, totally. That makes sense. That makes sense."
Rosa,Amy broke everything and got us kicked out of the bar. Then we got attacked by rats. It's the best Thanksgiving ever.
Charles,"It's a real culinary challenge. Give me 15 minutes, and then we feast."
Terry,Make it five.
Charles,"You eat with your eyes, so the plating alone..."
Rosa,"""I marked them 'Awk' for 'Awkward'?"""
Charles,"So this is kind of a play on your typical Thanksgiving dinner. For turkey, we have the Peking duck with a veggie samosa stuffing. The potatoes are the empanadas with an Ethiopian lentil stew gravy. And for dessert, some seasonal gelatin cups. Okay, I ran out of money. They're from when Hitchcock got his colonoscopy. Bon appétit. (Takes a seat)"
Rosa,What are you wearing?
Terry,"Nope, not doing that again. Move."
Terry,"You get that hand near me again, you're gonna lose it."
Charles,"So, you pretty much got the disaster night you were hoping for?"
Rosa,"Yeah, till you made the best Thanksgiving meal I've ever had and ruined it."
Charles,That was perfect.
Charles,I've gone 42 years without a lump of coal I’m not gonna start now.
Charles,"Hit him in his fat, cherry cheeks!"
Charles,That’s right! Boom! I just kicked Santa in the testicles! ....Merry Christmas!
Charles,"Hey, my flight is at eight tonight. It’s domestic. Do you think I’ll be safe if I get to the airport five hours early?"
Charles,"Well, I am. But I’ve begun to feel like there is a small chance Rosa may not love me back."
Charles,"Hey, you wanna grab some dinner tonight?"
Rosa,That’s nice. And I like you as a person. But I’m just not interested in you romantically.
Charles,Coolio. He heads off.
Charles,Whattaya say we grab a drink?
Rosa,"Again- that’s sweet. But I’m not into you that way, and I have a boyfriend."
Charles,Gotcha! Raincheck.
Charles,A rose for Rosa.
Rosa,Listen to me: the healthy thing for you to do is move on.
Charles,So we’ve both decided that the healthy thing for me to do is move on.
Charles,"Thanks. You know, I kind of just realized--"
Charles,Gotcha. Raincheck on that convo.
Rosa,You’re the only one who did that.
Terry,"Sorry, Santiago, I don’t have time for that. My psych evaluation is today. They’re gonna decide if I’m ready to go back on the streets."
Charles,"Uh, I have to go, too. My flight’s in... Oh boy. Eight hours. I can make it, I’ll just buy a sandwich on the plane."
Rosa,"So, if Boyle, Peralta, and the sergeant are out--"
Terry,I think I’m ready. I’m no longer fixating on my fears.
Terry,Okay. That sounds... fun.
Terry,...I popped your pillow.
Charles,Buh-buh-buh-back in the Nine-Nine.
Charles,"Wow, is this all for me?"
Charles,"Oh, none of my pants fit over my butt cast. Lucky for me my mom lent me her leg warmers."
Charles,"Yeah, I know. Check out these doughnuts. Whoo-hoo!"
Charles,"Nope, nope. Everything's under control. I picked up a couple reacher grabbers."
Charles,"So I'm able to do everything that I used to do. So now, if you'll excuse me, I'm going to go make myself a morning cup of coffee like I do every day."
Charles,"Okay, okay."
Rosa,"Let me get that for you, Boyle."
Terry,"Ah... Hey, Charles, just take my coffee. It's fresh."
Charles,"Okay, I guess. I mean, if you don't mind."
Terry,"All right, you got it?"
Charles,No problem.
Charles,Cold milk.
Charles,It is coming out the bottom of my cast.
Rosa,I think he's into me.
Rosa,"Fear is a powerful aphrodisiac. Anyway, he said he wants to speak to ""John or Jack Peralta or whatever."""
Rosa,Yeah. He said he wants a deal. He has some information about some dude who steals Pontiacs.
Rosa,"Yeah, I just said that. Chill, man."
Rosa,Yeah.
Charles,"Backing up, guys."
Charles,"You know, the doctor said that if the b*llet was two millimeters to the left and a foot higher, I might never have walked again."
Terry,"Absolutely. Hey, Boyle. You want to choose where we order lunch from today?"
Charles,"Really? You're lifting the lifetime ban? I thought my lunch choices were ""horrifying adventures in diarrhea."""
Charles,All right! I've been craving Sudanese all day. I'll print out some menus.
Rosa,"Before we go any further, we need to know if you're for real. Describe the guy."
Rosa,So all you know is what a bunch of other mopes have said over the years. Anything else?
Rosa,"12 counts of identity theft, but I've been chasing him for a month."
Rosa,96.
Rosa,"1,000 push-ups, really?"
Rosa,Okay. I'm in.
Rosa,"It's a pact we made. It really just means ""trust me."" And I do."
Rosa,No way.
Rosa,Why stop there? Why not tell her you're an astronaut?
Rosa,"Fine. One false move, and I tase you in front of your mom."
Rosa,I love getting to know people. It's my jam.
Terry,But we'd love to hear it again.
Charles,"He said that if the b*llet was a fraction of an inch to the left and two feet up, it woulda hit my brain."
Terry,Oh... Yeah.
Rosa,You guys having fun?
Rosa,'Cause I'm not. His mom put this stupid braid in my hair.
Rosa,"No, you look like a Boyz II Men Easter album."
Terry,"Gina, we've been looking all over for you. You can't just disappear and leave a sign on your desk that says, ""gone leavin'."""
Charles,"Pedal, pedal, pedal, pedal, pedal, pedal, push. Pedal, pedal, pedal, pedal, pedal, push. All this cycling makes me feel like Lance Armstrong."
Charles,Wouldn't you like to know?
Rosa,There's no sign of anyone. You sure about this?
Terry,"Very cute, sir."
Terry,"I'm sorry, sir, but that's impossible. With the twins learning how to walk, chaos reigns at the Jeffords household. I can't let those innocent pups into that madhouse. Terry won't do you like that."
Terry,"That's cold, sir."
Rosa,"No, we do not. Something doesn't smell right to me."
Rosa,"Do I? One of you is a criminal, and the other one is dressed like Steve Harvey. It's over. I'm ending this now. Sorry, Jake."
Rosa,"Yeah. 1,000 push-ups."
Rosa,"What? That's not how this works. I said 1,000 push-ups, you have to back me up. That's the pact, end of story."
Rosa,I hope you understand how serious this is to me.
Rosa,Don't quote Die Hard.
Charles,"So, what'd I miss? Tell me all the jokes. Everything funny that happened."
Terry,Hitchcock called himself Scully by accident.
Charles,Great.
Charles,"Yeah, it's way down there by my butt. Oh, yeah. Yeah, yeah, that's it."
Charles,Yup.
Charles,Right there.
Charles,Oop. Found it. I'll be right back.
Rosa,We got eyes on the bandit. He's a block away.
Rosa,What is he doing?
Charles,"Hiding from me in the evidence room. They think I don't know, but Gina's been live tweeting the whole thing."
Charles,"Maybe it was too soon for me to come back. I would've just stayed at home, but I was getting lonely and bored. One day I looked out the window for four hours. I didn't see anything."
Rosa,That's it. I'm calling it.
Rosa,Hands on your head!
Rosa,He's gone. He ran.
Rosa,"Yeah, you did. Why don't you come back here and take me out to dinner?"
Terry,"Hey, Captain, we thought we'd get more work done in here, because..."
Terry,"I was in the bathroom with him, sir. It was a nightmare."
Terry,"But on the plus side, I think I know what to do with them."
Charles,Ah...
Rosa,"I got a lot of work to do, Peralta."
Rosa,"No, you can't."
Rosa,"I don't care about the push-ups, Jake. I care that you didn't honor our pact. I've always trusted you, and when you did that it made me feel like you don't trust me."
Rosa,"No, it won't. Now get down on the floor."
Rosa,I changed my mind.
Rosa,"Night, Peralta."
Rosa,"You said 2,000, remember?"
Charles,I know.
Charles,"Oh, my butt!"
Charles,"For exceptional acts of heroism or voluntary risk of personal safety. But, you know, six of one."
Terry,Seriously? The bet? They've been keeping score all year. It comes up all the time. What are you doing all day?
Rosa,What about your car?
Charles,"That thing is a date magnet. I mean, how many girls have you made out with in that car? Six?"
Charles,"No, Jakey, no! That car is your superpower. Thor would never wager his hammer. Neil Patrick Harris would never wager his showmanship. Losing that car will be the worst thing in the world for you."
Terry,"Okay, okay, okay. Then it is settled. If Peralta loses, Santiago gets his car. If Santiago loses, she goes for a date in said car."
Charles,Peanut butter will not be joining us.
Charles,"Rosa, hey, would you like to share a cup of coffee with me? I got some gorgeous new coffee beans."
Rosa,"Sure, that sounds great."
Charles,I'm trying to counteract the drowsiness from my pain meds. I took a double dose after the incident at the ceremony.
Charles,"The footage from my fall led the local news, so who's the hero now, Peanut Butter?"
Charles,"Gina, you're just trying to hurt me to distract yourself from your own internal pain. Also, you should use less conditioner, because this is a flat mess."
Rosa,His pain meds are making him weird.
Charles,"Thank you, sir. Your breath is terrible."
Charles,"Hey, where's Rosa? I haven't seen her all night. Did you know my wife pays me alimony?"
Charles,Okay. Thanks.
Terry,"Hey, baby. Happy you made it. Captain, I'd like you to meet my wife, Sharon."
Terry,"He means metaphorically. You know, saving him from all that paperwork. Paper cuts are a slow death, baby."
Terry,Nooo!
Terry,"I thought I told you. Remember when you were half asleep watching the news and the babies were quiet, and I said, real low, ""hey, baby. I'm back in the field. You want something to eat?"" And you were like, ""what?"" And I was like, ""you want something to eat?"" And you said, ""sure."" And I got you an oatmeal cookie? Remember?"
Terry,"Oh, damn. She called me Terrance. I'm doomed."
Charles,"Yes, I want women to be impressed by me."
Charles,"Jake, do you know why little boys pull little girls' pigtails on playgrounds?"
Charles,"Because they like the girls, and that's the only way they know how to get their attention."
Charles,"All of this teasing, this elaborate date, somewhere down deep, you like Amy. Like, ""like her,"" like her."
Charles,How much did you spend on tonight?
Charles,You're putting a lot of effort into a joke. Why don't you sit down and have a real conversation with her?
Charles,I'm ashamed of my living situation.
Rosa,I'm avoiding Boyle and his truth bombs.
Charles,I sometimes worry I'm gonna become you.
Rosa,He keeps saying he wants to talk to me. I'm afraid he's gonna tell me he loves me or propose marriage or something.
Rosa,He dove in front of those b*ll*ts for me. I can't be mean to him. I watched him make coffee for 28 minutes this morning. But I also can't lead him on.
Charles,Have you seen Rosa?
Charles,Romantic.
Terry,"Look, baby, I'm sorry, but Captain's life was in danger. I just did what I had to do. It was an impulse decision."
Charles,"Wait. I can fix this, Ray."
Terry,"Now is not the time, Boyle."
Terry,"I'm sorry, honey. I just didn't want you to worry."
Charles,Hey. I need to talk to you.
Rosa,Oh. It's happening?
Charles,Remember when I took those b*ll*ts for you?
Rosa,"Okay, let's do this. I think you're sweet--"
Charles,You can go on a long walk with a person. At sunset. Talking about nothing. And everything.
Rosa,Sounds awful. Hit the park. That's a dog.
Terry,My wife takes the babies to the park all the time.
Charles,"Hey, what's Kelly's favorite food?"
Terry,How old is Kelly again?
Charles,Could be either.
Charles,Yup.
Charles,"We spent two weeks undercover infiltrating the gym. ""Gym-filtrating"" it. I coined that. I think it'll really catch on if more people infiltrated gyms."
Charles,"Damn straight. Wait, why'd high five that?"
Charles,Damn straight I am.
Terry,"I was born ready. And then I was not born ready for a while, but now I'm back to being born ready."
Charles,The Ebony Falcon. His feathers are muscles.
Terry,"Let's talk strategy later tonight at my house. My wife's working late, I'm on daddy duty."
Charles,"But you're ready for this, right?"
Terry,Absolutely. I just need to put my precious babies to bed with a story.
Terry,"The Ebony Falcon needs to read Go, Dog, Go."
Terry,"You don't want to do this, man."
Terry,It hurts you every time.
Rosa,You don't have locks on your windows.
Rosa,They cost $8. You have a fur bedspread.
Rosa,We need an itemized list of everything that was stolen.
Rosa,Can't you just buy another knockoff?
Rosa,Can you estimate the value of everything that was taken?
Terry,Sorry about the mess.
Charles,"Hi, Cagney. Hi, Lacey."
Terry,"Well, we just finished story time. I'm gonna kiss the girls night-night, then we can get down to business. All right, time for night-night, girls."
Charles,"He is so strong but so gentle. He's like an enormous, muscular Ellen DeGeneres."
Terry,"You know, I just want to let you guys know that I love you girls so, so much okay? So sleep tight. You know, daddy will never leave you, right, girls?"
Charles,Gosh. Really makes you understand what he went through.
Charles,"Jake, where are you?"
Charles,Oh... This is a classy tepee. Should we get these instead of desks at work?
Charles,What? Why?
Charles,"Or his wife or other family or his more mature friends, but interesting point. Why is this just hitting you now?"
Charles,"If you have concerns, maybe you should talk to Terry about it."
Charles,"Yeah, that's why I've never tried to develop an edge. You can't lose what you don't have. No surprises."
Terry,What are you guys talking about?
Charles,International taxes and tariffs... Work.
Terry,So... What's the plan at the gym?
Terry,"Listen, man, I know everybody's worried about me being psychologically ready for this. But I promise you I am. No matter what happens, no matter how many b*ll*ts are flying, I'm gonna be right there in the middle of everything. I got your back."
Rosa,None of the partials returned any matches. Nobody in your building saw anything. We've hit a wall.
Rosa,"Captain, we swept the scene, ran the prints, canvassed the building. We followed procedure."
Terry,You sure you can lift this much weight?
Charles,"I gave his regular trainer the day off, I told him Trent would be filling in. It was an interesting interaction."
Charles,"Well, according to my new cloud-based scheduling system, your trainer is out, and Trent will be filling in."
Charles,I spent 40 minutes making that water bottle pyramid display. This guy is a psycho.
Terry,Nope. The longer we wait the more likely our cover gets blown. I'll make contact.
Terry,"Yup. A black Trent. One of many. Uh, what do you want to start with today?"
Charles,"I'm sure he's fine. I think the bigger issue is the complaint I received from an older gentleman saying you tried to hurry him off his machine, in open defiance of gym protocol."
Charles,"I know we're friends, but if you do that again, I'm gonna have to suspend your membership."
Charles,Me. I've become me.
Terry,"Nothing happened. Jacoby wanted to do wind sprints outside. You know, he's a mean dude, but I think I'm making progress. He asked to borrow my squat belt, I told him no, he respected that."
Terry,'Sup?
Terry,I didn't. Brooklyn Bulk Fitness.
Terry,I don't know why. I work out there all the time.
Terry,"What are you doing, Peralta? You just blew my cover!"
Terry,Or did you compromise an investigation and piss off a superior officer?
Rosa,What's the matter with you?
Rosa,A P.I.? These guys are hacks.
Rosa,"""Look up who Picasso is."""
Terry,"You blew our cover, man! Now I gotta go into an interrogation with no evidence and try to get Jacoby to rat out his distributors!"
Terry,"Point to your delts, Jake."
Terry,"You didn't have to hop in there, man. I can handle this. What's my name?"
Terry,What is my name?
Terry,And what does The Ebony Falcon do?
Terry,"Hell yeah, he does. Except now The Ebony Falcon is monogamous and too tired for sex, so his only indulgence is fresh fruit yogurt parfaits."
Charles,How's it going?
Charles,I've been waiting so long to hear you say those words. Come with me. Experience the future of cloud-based scheduling.
Charles,"I put all the trainers' schedules into a shared online calendar. Aside from the cucumber water at the front desk, it's probably my greatest accomplishment ever."
Charles,That's probably our supplier. We should set up a buy from this Vladimir Rincic.
Charles,Are you sure I shouldn't go get him? I feel a little uncomfortable leaving him out of this.
Rosa,She once said the best comedy of all time was The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo.
Rosa,Depends. How many g*ns do I still have hidden?
Rosa,Do I still have my knife? Nunchucks? Axe?
Rosa,"I know, but I want to play it out. Do I still have my throwing stars?"
Terry,You lied to me!
Terry,I'm a Detective Sergeant in the NYPD. Holt told me. Why are you cutting me out of the operation?
Terry,You gonna talk to me now?
Terry,"Oh, now I'm gonna hit you for real."
Terry,Worried about what?
Terry,Why didn't you just say something to me?
Terry,"Yeah, I get it. It's been a rough year. But I've learned to embrace my fears. It makes me a better cop."
Charles,Tacs one and two are set. 30 minutes until the bogeys arrive.
Terry,We good. And for the record... If I could be any kind of vacation... I'd be lake trip.
Rosa,You're here late.
Rosa,We are. Come on. We're taking you home.
Rosa,"We installed a second lock on your front door, put locks on the windows by the fire escape, and set all your lights on timers."
Terry,All right. It's time to catch some bad guys. Its good to be back.
Terry,"You're a weird guy, Jake."
Charles,The Ebony Falcon.
Terry,I left one for you.
Terry,Whoo!
Terry,Major crimes division just called. They're taking over your m*rder case. The Vulture is on his way here now.
Rosa,Ugh. You made us run up ten flights of stairs.
Charles,"Oh, no. I spilled coffee on you by accident."
Rosa,"Hey, Pembroke. What do you say we go talk about a case in the break room?"
Rosa,The case of how you got so damn sexy.
Terry,"All right, let's get started. So we have good news, and we have bad news."
Charles,"My Nana always said, ""bad news first, because the good news is probably a lie."" Fun fact, she made me cry a lot."
Rosa,"Good news is, the sting we set up to catch deadbeats went great."
Rosa,"You're not very bright, are you, Bill?"
Charles,Darn it. I had a belly dancing class. Tonight was Egyptian undulation.
Charles,Sure.
Terry,There's only three files here. It's been an hour.
Charles,"No. No, no, no, no. Tommy?"
Terry,"I may have a solution. We need to CompStat the office. What is CompStat? It's just using data to identify problem spots in the neighborhood. Now, I have been taking notes on points of friction in this office for years. The red areas are places where no work gets done. If we can fix these problems without anyone knowing what we're doing, we will finish on time."
Terry,Yes.
Terry,"Okay, so I've already taken care of a few obvious problems. I moved the toaster to the break room, far away from Boyle."
Terry,"Right, so you know about Rosa's anger incidents."
Rosa,"It's my birthday. I hate birthdays. If you wish me a Happy Birthday, I will punch you."
Terry,"Any time Mt. Diaz erupts, everyone on the squad avoids her."
Terry,"Tell me, what room is just down the hall from her desk?"
Terry,"Hey, Diaz, I just need to make sure I've got the details right in this file."
Rosa,"Yeah, guy was passing bad checks."
Terry,But is this the same guy?
Rosa,"Yeah, the name here is the same name on the checks."
Terry,"Okay, all right, thank you, thank you."
Terry,Got it.
Terry,"It's going really well, sir. We've gone from 10 cases per hour to almost 20."
Terry,Boyle gets cold a lot because of what he calls his...
Charles,Medically diagnosed thin skin.
Terry,"So he goes to the lost and found, and he grabs something that's usually unflattering. That's when Gina gets involved."
Terry,Gina is completely useless when Boyle is wearing lost-and-found clothes.
Terry,"Already done, sir."
Terry,Good lord. Where did he get that?
Terry,"He must have gotten it from the evidence locker or something. Don't worry. I had a backup plan. I distracted her with a mirror. She's like a cockatiel, sir... Fascinated by her own reflection."
Charles,Right back at ya.
Terry,"We've done it, sir. If we stay on this pace, I think we'll finish on time."
Terry,"Sir, are you familiar with the story of Icarus? He didn't know when to quit. He flew too close to the sun, and his wax wings melted, and he died."
Terry,Icarus.
Rosa,"Extinguisher's empty, morons."
Terry,"Sir, I'm begging you, please, we have to stop. Boyle is still smoldering."
Terry,"Gina, what are you doing in the Captain's chair?"
Charles,You melted my fringe.
Rosa,You think I have an anger problem? I don't. You are both dead to me.
Terry,"Really? A tad, icarus?"
Terry,What's going on?
Rosa,I knew just where to punch it to get free food. Now I have to go back to punching Hitchcock.
Terry,"Look, she still has the bags of baby carrots I requested they put in. They're black now, but they're there."
Terry,What in the world?
Terry,What letter?
Terry,"Oh, hell yeah."
Terry,"Oh, my God, she doesn't even do that on airplanes."
Charles,"Rosa, I know you don't like anyone wishing you a happy birthday, so crappy day to you."
Rosa,Still too much.
Charles,I assume you're not doing anything to celebrate tonight.
Rosa,Anyone over the age of six celebrating a birthday should go to hell.
Charles,"So since you're free, I need your help moving this old Ms. Pac-Man machine I just bought."
Rosa,Why are you so obsessed with that game?
Charles,"Because it's the sexiest video game ever. She's insatiable, Rosa. Insatiable. Insatiab..."
Rosa,"Stop saying ""insatiable."""
Charles,"Anyway, I bought this old machine from a bar, and I was hoping you'd help me move it."
Rosa,You want me to go to a bar?
Charles,Mm-hmm.
Rosa,You are obviously trying to get me to go to a surprise party. Did Marcus put you up to this?
Charles,"What? No, that's crazy talking. We just need to be there at exactly 9:45 p.m. and not a minute earlier. Also, there's a particular door I want us to enter through."
Rosa,Maybe he's having dinner with his sidepiece first.
Rosa,"You look fine. Here, wear this. Jake, you need a jacket or something."
Charles,"Well, Scully left his sports coat back there. Oh, but it will never fit Jake's athletic body. Unless..."
Charles,You have to.
Charles,You're doing it.
Charles,Don Johnson it!
Terry,Nice job. What's the plan?
Terry,We got the letter.
Rosa,Who else is going?
Charles,"Rosa, listen to me, there is no party. Just get off my doughnut already."
Rosa,"Don't lie to me, Boyle, or you will be eating your bone marrow custard through a straw."
Charles,That's exactly how you're supposed to eat bone marrow
Rosa,- Charles! -
Charles,"Ah! All right, there's a party. I can't give you details. All I can say is I know you, and I know you'll have a good time."
Rosa,"If you knew me, you'd know I hate surprise parties, so clearly you don't know me at all."
Charles,"What? We're friends. I was building up to calling you ""Ro-ro"" one of these days."
Rosa,"That will never happen. In fact, you just lost ""Rosa"" privileges. From now on, you can call me ""Diaz"" or ""Hey, you."""
Charles,"Come on, Rosa. Come on, hey, you."
Terry,Buckle up. It's gonna be a hell of a ride.
Terry,Oh.
Terry,What is going on?
Charles,So how was the restaurant?
Charles,Why are you being weird?
Charles,What?!
Charles,Tell me everything!
Rosa,"Yeah, who cares about a kiss? Call me if you grab each other's asses. He's pulling over. It's going down."
Charles,"You guys are so naive. It's never nothing. In high school, I played Daddy Warbucks in Annie, Becca Murse played Annie, and we were supposed to hug onstage. And at first, that seemed like nothing too, but by opening night, we were full-on making out."
Charles,Mm-hmm. The audience was not on board. Playwright sued the school.
Rosa,"Guys, guys, it's not a handoff. He's leaving the package."
Charles,"Right, and you and Amy follow your hearts."
Charles,And each other forever.
Rosa,We can't pull him over this close to the drop site. It'll alert the buyer. I say we follow him for a mile.
Charles,Copy that. How's your mom enjoying the new phone you got her for her birthday on March 16th?
Rosa,"Dude, stop saying random facts to try to prove you know me."
Charles,"That's not what I'm doing. I'm simply making small talk with my friend Rosa, who went skydiving once."
Rosa,Enough! I'm going to the dumb party but only because I don't want to hurt Marcus. I'm still super mad at you.
Charles,"Mm, like how you're still super mad at Gilmore Girls for how the finale went down?"
Rosa,"Oh, I just want to see Lorelai happy, and shut up!"
Charles,"Ah, see? I knew you so well, I knew it was co ah!"
Charles,"Okay, before we go in, remember you have to pretend to be surprised."
Rosa,"How's this? Oh, my God. It's so much worse than I imagined."
Charles,"The energy was great, but the message was flawed."
Rosa,"All right, let's get this over with."
Rosa,What's going on?
Rosa,This is incredible.
Charles,"I told you I knew you, Ro-ro."
Rosa,"Thank you. But never call me ""Ro-ro"" again."
Charles,"Oh, but I will. I've earned this. Happy b-day, Ro-ro. Whoo!"
Charles,"Hey, Jake, the new captain's here."
Rosa,Wow.
Terry,"Come on, guys. I know you're sad, but let's do our best to make a good first impression here."
Charles,"Jake, you be up front."
Terry,"Well done, sir. Welcome to the Nine-Nine. I'm Sergeant Terry Jeffords."
Terry,Get a doctor!
Terry,Briefing room. Five minutes.
Terry,"So sorry, sir. That's terrible."
Rosa,What the hell are these?
Rosa,"Sarge, I don't need to be monitored all day long. I'm not a toddler. This is stupid."
Terry,"I know you're not a toddler, because my toddlers know that ""stupid"" is a no-no word. Keep that Dozer-pad on you at all times."
Rosa,"Fine, but I am gonna play the hell out of some backgammon. Watch me."
Charles,"Bouche Manger. Oh, small plates, casual-chic ambiance, no free soda refills...Jakey's going on a date. Are you going on a date with Amy?"
Charles,"Uh, because you guys just kissed on that mission."
Charles,"What? Why is this the first time I'm hearing about her? Or that you go to the gym? Jake, avoid the weights. Nobody wants you turning into another Terry. Ugh."
Terry,Hey. People like the way that I look.
Charles,"Sure they do, big guy. Look, I can't believe you're gonna take some fitness floozy to Bouche Manger. You should be going with Amy. Right, Amy?"
Charles,"Oh, you sweet, naive boy. I haven't even begun to pressure you two. I've already written my best man speech for your wedding. Oh, I'm gonna need you to get married on a farm. A lot of my jokes rely on that."
Charles,So how was the date with the floozy? We are not leaving these seats until you give me some deets.
Charles,Did you kiss? Did you french?
Charles,"Oh, that's a yes. Oh my God, you had sex. I can tell because you're glowing. Ugh, Jake, no one wants to hear about your sex life."
Charles,"Because I was rooting for you and Amy, but now I can see you're super serious about this anonymous gym seductress. Ugh, I'm so sorry, Amy."
Rosa,I'd love to see you date someone from work. Your head would explode.
Rosa,Mm. Sick burn.
Terry,"Peralta, Dozerman says he wants to see you."
Terry,What's that noise?
Rosa,I don't hear anything.
Rosa,What? I put it up there for safe keeping.
Terry,Safe keeping?
Rosa,"Yeah. I had it on my desk, but I kept spilling coffee on it. Oops."
Terry,"Come on, Diaz."
Terry,What happened in there?
Terry,Can you think of anything that may have caused Dozerman to be startled?
Terry,"That seems unlikely, but obviously he had a ton of health problems, so, you know, this seems pretty open and shut. Do me a favor and pull the surveillance tapes."
Terry,You two have something to tell me?
Charles,"Yes! Oh! Wait. What about the gym floozy? Amy was the gym floozy. The gym floozy was under my nose the whole time. Oh, I am over the moon."
Charles,Over the moon.
Rosa,So what is this? Casual? Serious? I need to know how to make fun of you. You guys dating?
Rosa,"Oh, that's not good."
Terry,"Enough. Look. Terry loves love, but Terry also loves maintaining a professional work environment. As your commanding officer, I am very disappointed in both of you."
Rosa,"So, Boyle…"
Charles,Mm.
Rosa,"Let's go look at those surveillance tapes, yeah?"
Charles,"Oh, absolutely."
Terry,"I know. Get off my back, computer ghost."
Rosa,"Why are you still playing with that stupid game, Sarge? The guy is dead."
Terry,It's not a game. I'm following our captain's orders.
Rosa,"His orders were stupid. I hated him more than any cop I've ever known. Whoa. I just realized I'm never gonna be able to say that to his face. I mean, I could say it to his wife at the funeral, but it won't be the same."
Terry,"He was trying to make our precinct better. Look. Holt's gone, Dozerman died. Who knows who we're getting next? I'm just trying to keep this place running. That's my job. Case cleared! Yeah, how do you like me now, sucker? I mean, I hope you found peace."
Charles,"No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no…"
Charles,"No, no, no, no, no! This is not how you and Amy are supposed to end. You're supposed to grow old and die holding each other as your cruise ship slowly takes on water."
Charles,Light and breezy?
Charles,"Light and breezy is how you describe a linen pantsuit, not a relationship you care about."
Charles,Cautious?
Charles,"You guys started this with one foot out the door. That's what doomed you, not the universe."
Charles,I'm sorry. I'm just so excited about all this!
Charles,"Easy. You march over there, you tell her how you feel, and you bring a fancy bottle of lavender shampoo, because shampooing a woman's head is the most erotic thing you could ever possibly—"
Charles,"Yes! Go get her. No! Wait till it starts raining. No, that's crazy. Go now."
Charles,"Guys, we did it. We really did it."
Terry,"Wow, Diaz. That's the first time I've seen him smile."
Rosa,I didn't do it for him. I did it 'cause it's my job. We cool?
Terry,We're cool.
Rosa,Good.
Terry,"There's a rumor the new captain'll be here today. Now, I don't know who Wuntch is sending us, but it doesn't matter, because we're a family, we're strong, and together, we can do anything. Nine-Nine!"
Rosa,Still hot.
Terry,"Okay, squad, the funeral's at 3:00, followed by a reception at Shaw's Bar. I want you all on your best behavior."
Rosa,He stared at me for 90 seconds while he ate an entire peach.
Charles,At least he doesn't practice his crane kicks with you.
Charles,I didn't move.
Charles,Pillow talk alert! Set the scene. Spooning or face-to-face?
Charles,Spooning.
Charles,"Hey, G-spot!"
Rosa,"Really? 'Cause when you left, you made a pretty big deal of deleting us from your phone."
Rosa,I don't think we're that dramatic.
Charles,"Nope. Not unless you call hooking up with a girl at a funeral ""weird and tragic."""
Charles,"Her name is Lieutenant Singh. She's super hot. We were seated next to each other two funerals ago. And there was hard eye contact all through ""Danny Boy."" Last funeral, we made out in the parking lot. This time...something naughty this way comes."
Rosa,Ugh. What do you even know about this person?
Charles,"Oh, we don't know anything about each other. She says she likes that about us. It's just pure animal attraction."
Rosa,This is creepy and unlike you. You even know her first name?
Charles,"Oh, um, do animals in the wild know each other's names? Look, all I know is, Charles Boyle is going to that funeral, and he's going to put the ""bone"" back in boneyard."
Terry,"Sir, I'm sorry to interrupt, but I need you to sign these—Captain Holt! I didn't realize you were here."
Terry,Welcome back.
Terry,"Okay, guys, I know Captain Dozerman was a nightmare and that none of us liked him. But I'm gonna need all of you to pretend like you're sad. Everyone make a sad face. Scully, you are nailing it!"
Terry,"Good, use it. Now, anyone seen Captain Holt? He seemed a little down when he came in."
Terry,"I got to go find him. Now, be respectful and grieve your asses off."
Terry,"Scully, I love it! Everyone follow his lead."
Charles,"Hello, Lieutenant."
Charles,"Yes, real tragic."
Charles,I've been doing lunges in the shower.
Rosa,"Well, this got upsetting real quick."
Charles,"I'll meet you, all right. M-E-A-T. Still think it's creepy?"
Rosa,"Charles, it is not like you to have sex with a total stranger."
Charles,Really? Tell that to me in an hour when we've had sex 23 times.
Terry,"There you are. You okay, sir?"
Terry,"Whoa, whoa, whoa! Slow down, sir. You didn't even stop and sniff the bouquet. You always sniff the bouquet."
Terry,"Maybe the old Holt did. But the new Holt chugs Beaujolais from a Burgundy glass without a care. Oh, it's a Sauternes glass. Look, the alcohol has rendered me a simpleton."
Terry,Maybe you should just call it a day.
Terry,"One tweak: maybe you should lose the word ""pain,"" and then get in a cab and go home."
Terry,"One drink, and then we go."
Terry,My tolerance has really changed since I had kids!
Charles,"Whoa, whoa, whoa. Can we slow down?"
Charles,"No, no, no. My friends are just in my head. They think it's weird that we don't know anything about each other."
Charles,"Totally. I'm glad we're not interested in each other as human beings. Oh, how about if you tell me things about yourself and then I tell you how little I care about them?"
Charles,Not interested.
Charles,Who even asked you?
Charles,I don't care what you like. But maybe you could tell me one more thing.
Charles,She's a vegan!
Rosa,What is going on?
Charles,"You're right. I couldn't help myself. I wanted to know about her. And I got what I deserved: a vegan, a gluten-free vegan!"
Charles,"No. You called it, Rosa. So go ahead. Laugh at me! Laugh! Laugh it up!"
Rosa,Can I wait till after the funeral?
Charles,Of course you can.
Terry,"Sir, my life stinks. Sharon's on bed rest. My favorite mango yogurt got discontinued. And my kids think their preschool teacher's a stupidface."
Terry,Sir?
Terry,Sir?
Terry,Sir?
Terry,Can I be honest? Precinct's not the same without you. The Vulture's the worst. My mango yogurt—
Terry,"'Cause it's important! When I saw you in the office this morning, I wanted to give you the biggest hug."
Terry,I hate going to work and you're not there. Everything is garbage.
Terry,That's a really good idea!
Terry,Whoo!
Terry,"Move over, Peralta! Move over! Okay. And if I may do a third toast. It'll be focused primarily on the mango yogurt. Don't boo me! I lost something important too, shoot."
Charles,Trying to get drunk enough to have sexual intercourse with a vegan. Why can't I just think with my junk like a modern man?
Rosa,Why do you want to do that?
Charles,"I got divorced, and I was crushed. My fiance left, I cried for weeks. My only relationship that wasn't totally devastating when it ended was my casual sex carnival with Gina."
Rosa,"Yeah, okay, But with of those relationships made you happiest before it ended?"
Charles,My marriage. Vivian.
Rosa,"Dude, you can't go through life trying not to get hurt. You should try to be happy."
Charles,So you think I should look for someone I can have emotional intercourse with.
Rosa,"I wish you hadn't said it like that, but yeah."
Charles,And I should start right here at this funeral.
Charles,"Nope, no time to lose. Put on your sunglasses. I need to see if there's anything in my teeth."
Rosa,Ugh.
Charles,"Oh, yeah. Charles Boyle is ready for love."
Rosa,"Well, never wearing these again."
