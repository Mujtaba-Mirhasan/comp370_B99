Nope.,Conversation Glue
Nope.,Conversation Glue
Scully.,Conversation Glue
Nice.,Conversation Glue
Yeah!,Conversation Glue
Coolio. He heads off.,Conversation Glue
"Oh, boy.",Conversation Glue
Come on!,Conversation Glue
What's up?,Conversation Glue
What's happening?,Conversation Glue
You know I do.,Conversation Glue
Wow.,Conversation Glue
Worse.,Conversation Glue
"Boyle says, ""Come on, guys."" That's two for Terry.",Conversation Glue
Yes.,Conversation Glue
I'll pay for that.,Conversation Glue
"Nah, I think I'm good.",Conversation Glue
Good. You shouldn't know it.,Conversation Glue
I didn't ask what you were doing. I asked what you are doing.,Conversation Glue
You asked us to come in here.,Conversation Glue
Please do.,Conversation Glue
"""I marked them 'Awk' for 'Awkward'?""",Conversation Glue
What are you wearing?,Conversation Glue
No way.,Conversation Glue
I know!,Conversation Glue
Good.,Conversation Glue
Yeah.,Conversation Glue
"Come on, guys.",Conversation Glue
"So, Boyle…",Conversation Glue
Gina!,Conversation Glue
Yeah.,Conversation Glue
You’re the only one who did that.,Conversation Glue
"Yeah, I just said that. Chill, man.",Conversation Glue
I have an idea...,Conversation Glue
Nice. (Holding coffee),Conversation Glue
What? What's going on?,Conversation Glue
Yeah.,Conversation Glue
Uh-huh. My turn?,Conversation Glue
You guys having fun?,Conversation Glue
Smart. Good call.,Conversation Glue
He seems like he would.,Conversation Glue
Sir? Thank you.,Conversation Glue
I'm backing it up.,Conversation Glue
What's this?,Conversation Glue
Wait... Hitchcock?,Conversation Glue
What is happening?,Conversation Glue
Really?,Conversation Glue
What do you need?,Conversation Glue
"No, sir.",Conversation Glue
"Whoa, Detective Santiago.",Conversation Glue
No.,Conversation Glue
Does it really say that?,Conversation Glue
What is all this?,Conversation Glue
He seems cool.,Conversation Glue
I don't hear anything.,Conversation Glue
"Oh, I'm gonna find out anyway.",Conversation Glue
Why? What'd you do?,Conversation Glue
"Um, Hitchcock.",Conversation Glue
Yay.,Conversation Glue
What? I put it up there for safe keeping.,Conversation Glue
What?,Conversation Glue
So pretty much the same as what I said.,Conversation Glue
"All right, let's get this over with.",Conversation Glue
Gotcha! Raincheck.,Conversation Glue
Here she is.,Conversation Glue
Pass.,Conversation Glue
Just to be safe? What does that mean?,Conversation Glue
Yeah.,Conversation Glue
I know.,Conversation Glue
Icarus.,Conversation Glue
Why do you care so much about some old reporter?,Conversation Glue
Ah...,Conversation Glue
"Sure, that sounds great.",Conversation Glue
"Already done, sir.",Conversation Glue
"Yeah, nice!",Conversation Glue
Got it.,Conversation Glue
"Okay, all right, thank you, thank you.",Conversation Glue

What's that noise?,Conversation Glue
Yeah. What's your second point?,Conversation Glue
And go!,Conversation Glue
Sure.,Conversation Glue
Great.,Conversation Glue
Thank you.,Conversation Glue
I know how to blink.,Conversation Glue

Okay. I'm in.,Conversation Glue
Why are we meeting in the ladies' room?,Conversation Glue
Mm-hmm.,Conversation Glue
Yep.,Conversation Glue
No.,Conversation Glue
Yes.,Conversation Glue
"Yeah, he seems cool. I agree.",Conversation Glue
Morning.,Conversation Glue
Great.,Conversation Glue
What about your car?,Conversation Glue
Where was it?,Conversation Glue
Okay. That sounds... fun.,Conversation Glue
"Yes, sir.",Conversation Glue
"Nope, not doing that again. Move.",Conversation Glue
Nothing.,Conversation Glue
"No, you are not, Jake Rabbit.",Conversation Glue
Your what friend now?,Conversation Glue
You think?,Conversation Glue
Gotcha. Raincheck on that convo.,Conversation Glue
Where's he taking you?,Conversation Glue
No. Where is it?,Conversation Glue
"Could be a year. Could be a decade. Sorry, we're just saying bigger and bigger numbers.",Conversation Glue
You okay?,Conversation Glue
Hey. What's going on?,Conversation Glue
So what you're saying is that this is kind of a...,Conversation Glue
You know I will.,Conversation Glue
Yes!,Conversation Glue
Is that a nightgown?,Conversation Glue
No.,Conversation Glue
Still too much.,Conversation Glue
"All right, you got it?",Conversation Glue
"Thank you, Boyle. I appreciate it.",Conversation Glue
But we'd love to hear it again.,Conversation Glue
"You said 2,000, remember?",Conversation Glue
Lady bin?,Conversation Glue
'Sup?,Conversation Glue
"Night, Peralta.",Conversation Glue
I changed my mind.,Conversation Glue
"Absolutely, sir. Where do we start?",Conversation Glue
Who else is going?,Conversation Glue
"Backing up, guys.",Conversation Glue
Choo. Yes.,Conversation Glue
"No, you can't.",Conversation Glue
What is he doing?,Conversation Glue
No problem.,Conversation Glue
"I know, it’s crazy.",Conversation Glue
Why are you smiling? That's nothin’.,Conversation Glue
"Well, we shall see what we shall see.",Conversation Glue
"Okay, okay.",Conversation Glue
- Charles! -,Conversation Glue
96,Conversation Glue
Good.,Conversation Glue
"Well, this got upsetting real quick.",Emotion
"Really? 'Cause when you left, you made a pretty big deal of deleting us from your phone.",Emotion
"Oh, that's brutal.",Emotion
"It's a pact we made. It really just means ""trust me."" And I do.",Emotion
This is incredible.,Emotion
"Oh, that's not good.",Emotion
Oh. It's happening?,Emotion
"No, Jakey, no! That car is your superpower. Thor would never wager his hammer. Neil Patrick Harris would never wager his showmanship. Losing that car will be the worst thing in the world for you.",Emotion
Ugh. You made us run up ten flights of stairs.,Emotion
"Oh, my butt!",Emotion
Here. I feel bad that you spent all that money on the movie tickets.,Emotion
"I don't care about the push-ups, Jake. I care that you didn't honor our pact. I've always trusted you, and when you did that it made me feel like you don't trust me.",Emotion
"Okay, I guess. I mean, if you don't mind.",Emotion
I hope you understand how serious this is to me.,Emotion
"What? That's not how this works. I said 1,000 push-ups, you have to back me up. That's the pact, end of story.",Emotion
"Wow, is this all for me?",Emotion
"His orders were stupid. I hated him more than any cop I've ever known. Whoa. I just realized I'm never gonna be able to say that to his face. I mean, I could say it to his wife at the funeral, but it won't be the same.",Emotion
Enough! I'm going to the dumb party but only because I don't want to hurt Marcus. I'm still super mad at you.,Emotion
"How's this? Oh, my God. It's so much worse than I imagined.",Emotion
"Ever since, I kinda got scared of getting hurt. Lost my edge. There was an incident in a department store.",Emotion
"Thank you. But never call me ""Ro-ro"" again.",Emotion
That’s right! Boom! I just kicked Santa in the testicles! ....Merry Christmas!,Emotion
That was perfect.,Emotion
"So, you pretty much got the disaster night you were hoping for?",Emotion
"There. Now you’re hurt in this chair. You can get hurt anywhere, Boyle. And if you do, it won’t be because some shoe salesman predicted it. You make your own destiny.",Emotion
Damn it.,Emotion
I'm a textbook people-pleaser. I have a serious problem. This was great though. You must be so proud.,Emotion
That's a victory. That's a victory for Boyle. Boom!,Emotion
"Thanks. You know, I kind of just realized--",Emotion
I’m fine. I'm fine.,Emotion
What's wrong with the way I dress?,Emotion
That's never happened before. I don't like it.,Emotion
"I was born ready. And then I was not born ready for a while, but now I'm back to being born ready.",Emotion
"Oh, my god.",Emotion
"I don’t know, man. I’m lost. The universe is a cruel and vexing puzzle. I-I’m at the whim of the cosmos.",Emotion
"Um, Carlene predicted if I get out of this chair, I’d get badly hurt, so I’m not chancing it. Oh, man. There’s no more pudding cups left. Ah! What’d you do that for?",Emotion
"Now is not the time, Boyle.",Emotion
"Oh, damn. She called me Terrance. I'm doomed.",Emotion
Nooo!,Emotion
Damn it! This is Jeffrey Dahmer's corduroys all over again.,Emotion
"You don't want to do this, man.",Emotion
"That's cold, sir.",Emotion
"Ah, come on!",Emotion
I think I’m ready. I’m no longer fixating on my fears.,Emotion
Make it five.,Emotion
Huh. Boyle's advice worked.,Emotion
"No, I'm still furious at you.",Emotion
You people already know too much about me.,Emotion
I would never steal his thunder. I-I'd be afraid to borrow it.,Emotion
And I'm still not right.,Emotion
Oh... Yeah.,Emotion
"Yeah, I feel sexy.",Emotion
It hurts you every time.,Emotion
"So you were lying? What the hell, Boyle?",Emotion
"So sorry, sir. That's terrible.",Emotion
"Come on, guys. I know you're sad, but let's do our best to make a good first impression here.",Emotion
To be perfectly candid... I like that.,Emotion
What in the world?,Emotion
I look like arsenio.,Emotion
Why? I'm fine on the stand.,Emotion
That's not helping!,Emotion
"Sir, I'm begging you, please, we have to stop. Boyle is still smoldering.",Emotion
You lied to me!,Emotion
"I don't know, I didn't wanna mess up. Because you're sort of... Opinionated.",Emotion
"Okay. Well, this is awkward.",Emotion
Dream team.,Emotion
Of course I'm nervous! What did you think was the problem?,Emotion
"Damn, it is amazing.",Emotion
She also made this really depressing prediction about my life.,Emotion
"Yeah, I get it. It's been a rough year. But I've learned to embrace my fears. It makes me a better cop.",Emotion
Why didn't you just say something to me?,Emotion
Worried about what?,Emotion
Good lord. Where did he get that?,Emotion
"Oh, my God, enough.",Emotion
You have a problem with me that you want to talk about?,Emotion
Yeah! Winning by default!,Emotion
So fun.,Emotion
"Shut it! Holt was right. I've been so worried about my own kids, I forgot about my stupid grown-up kids.",Emotion
It's just the target looks exactly like a friend of mine. It's just freaking me out.,Emotion
I just need a second.,Emotion
I can't believe you tricked me!,Emotion
Don't shush me. I'm helping you.,Emotion
That's the spirit!,Emotion
"Sir, I may not be the man for the job.",Emotion
"Sir, I haven't fired a weapon since the incident.",Emotion
Sorry you got vultured. Happens to the best of us.,Emotion
You mean drive you there and wait outside... Far away from the guns.,Emotion
So it's... perfect?,Emotion
"No! I can do this. It's just driving me a little crazy. Where do I affix the princess tower, Boyle?! Where do I affix it?!",Emotion
This is not good. The lawyer is that slimeball grundhaven... Rosa hates him!,Emotion
Yes. You have to pull it together.,Emotion
"That's what sarge says to me when I'm nervous. Rosa, I think you're nervous.",Emotion
"But if the problem is that you're nervous, that's where Charles Boyle lives, baby. I can help! You just need to go to your happy place.",Emotion
She went to her happy place.,Emotion
"Yes, I did, and I am thrilled with the results. Although the jar is really hot.",Emotion
"Oh, I love being Scary Terry. He says what regular Terry's thinking.",Emotion
"Not now, Boyle. Let a brother breathe. Let a brother breathe.",Emotion
I cannot figure you out.,Emotion
"It's gonna be a long road, but I'm ready to get myself back in the game.",Emotion
"Way to go, Jakey.",Emotion
I'm always the victim. I don't want to be the victim.,Emotion
No. I'll be the victim. Don't make me a door again.,Emotion
Wow!,Emotion
"Thank you, sir. I'll never forget it.",Emotion
"It's whack, and you know it. Their number-one crime is tricycle theft. There's a bakery attached to the precinct. Come on, Santiago. You never would've taken that job, so why'd you even care that they offered it to me?",Emotion
This is such a disaster.,Emotion
"What? (laughs nervously) That is not true, okay? I-I-I don't even like food.",Emotion
He makes me feel so small.,Emotion
I'm sorry I couldn't convince you to love Halloween.,Emotion
"Well, you're not the only girl at the table anymore. We work in a police force full of dudes. We gotta have each other's backs, okay?",Emotion
"Yeah, I got your back. Don't smile. I'm still mad at you.",Emotion
"Ha! ""Boyle objects to Boyle Bingo.""",Emotion
You paid money to get out of working with me?,Emotion
Damn!,Emotion
"Look, Jake, I love you like you're one of my daughters.",Emotion
"'Stume! Oh, my God. It caught on.",Emotion
I can do it.,Emotion
"Yeah, till you made the best Thanksgiving meal I've ever had and ruined it.",Food
Great! Now I'm starving!,Food
"Boyle, you're always blogging on that foodie website. Which pie's better?",Food
"I owe you one, Boyle. Thank-you dinner. Tomorrow night. Gribaldi's. It's all-you-can-eat linguini.",Food
"Hey, Gina, can you order food for us at the Flatbush Diner? They make the best pies in New York City.",Food
"Pie taste test, it's over. I won.",Food
I think it was flan.,Food
It's all right. 6 out of 12.,Food
Is it in your pockets?,Food
Where is it?,Food
I love yogurt.,Food
"Everything's spoiled. My lunch is ruined. My chicken, my potatoes, my pasta, my meatballs, ham, my yogurt. (Takes out every meal)",Food
"Damn it, Boyle. You left the fridge open. The door couldn't shut because of your empty pizza box.(Takes out the pizza box)",Food
"Actually, I don't like pickles that much.",Food
"The department never washes them, so it's probably vomit. Hey! I got you a chocolate. Yet another great thing about Halloween... chocolate!",Food
Bring out the meringues.,Food
I'm gonna shake it out of your pockets. Turn around.,Food
Another one for Crust. It's not looking good for Flatbush Diner.,Food
Kitchen buds.,Food
"For the 12 components of food satisfaction: Salty, sweet, sour, bitter, umami, odor, sound...",Food
"Oh, wow. That's the best pie I ever had.",Food
(sighs) I'm sorry about the whole pie blowup thing. You're right. The Flatbush Diner pie is awful.,Food
"Hey, Rosa, the Flatbush Diner's pie is terrible. It's inedible. Food is supposed to be edible.",Food
"Crust isn't any better. It's fancier, but it's all bells and whistles. Desserts don't need to be clever. They just need to be good. This is the best pie in New York City... Apple from Argos Bakery, founded 1910. Recipe unchanged. Taste it.",Food
"You just graduated pie school, bitches. Sorry I said ""bitches,"" I'm just really worked up.",Food
"I'm sorry, Jake, Sal's is only the eighth-best. I put out a weekly Brooklyn pizza-ranking email blast. Sal's has the fourth-best texture, ninth-best crust, twelfth-best cheese, and honestly, they're only seventh in mouth-feel.",Food
"That's unacceptable. If you wanna know which restaurant has better pies, you can't just have one guy try one pie from each place. Everybody needs to try all the pies from both places. We gonna be here awhile.",Food
"Mario is number ten overall in Brooklyn, and rising fast. He might've wanted to move up the ladder.",Food
Release your sweets.,Food
Why wouldn't you? They're both white powders. Of course they're interchangeable.,Food
"Oh, man! My muffin. Ahh! Oh, my head! My muffin, my head! And I stepped on the... On my muffin! And my head and my muffin.",Food
"Jamon lberico is an amazing cured ham from Spain. They had it at my uncle's funeral. I gorged myself at that funeral. I mean, I was constipated for three days.",Food
"Look, she still has the bags of baby carrots I requested they put in. They're black now, but they're there.",Food
Jamon lberico.,Food
Beneficio's might.,Food
"Oh! I'm Henry Morgenthau, owner of delicious and expensive hams. Don't I know you from the grocery store?",Food
That's a waste of manchego!,Food
I left one for you.,Food
"No waiting, just toasting. I want you to toast. Now I wanna eat toast. Give me some toast!",Food
"Absolutely. Hey, Boyle. You want to choose where we order lunch from today?",Food
There's a lot of food up there?,Food
You could eat off his shirt.,Food
"Don't worry, guys, I found food. (Sets a box down and eat the packing peanuts)",Food
But the cook is coming back.,Food
Do you have any more of these pretzels?,Food
I ate one string bean. It tasted like fish vomit. That was it for me.,Food
Toilet.,Food
Can't. I'm so stuffed.,Food
"Ah... Hey, Charles, just take my coffee. It's fresh.",Food
It'll be the perfect opportunity to update my rankings. Can we stop at home for a pizza bib?,Food
I'll just use my work bib.,Food
Gino... This pizza is much better than last time. You've always ranked dead last in structural integrity and sauce.,Food
Peanut butter will not be joining us.,Food
I knew just where to punch it to get free food. Now I have to go back to punching Hitchcock.,Food
All right! I've been craving Sudanese all day. I'll print out some menus.,Food
"Really? You're lifting the lifetime ban? I thought my lunch choices were ""horrifying adventures in diarrhea.""",Food
Cold milk.,Food
"Yeah, I know. Check out these doughnuts. Whoo-hoo!",Food
"In a word, yes. Amateurs go tasting, they fill up, and they lose their palate by the third slice. I take this very seriously.",Food
"You eat with your eyes, so the plating alone...",Food
"It's a real culinary challenge. Give me 15 minutes, and then we feast.",Food
"Tommy, can we order some food?",Food
"So this is your lunch for, like, the month?",Food
"So this is kind of a play on your typical Thanksgiving dinner. For turkey, we have the Peking duck with a veggie samosa stuffing. The potatoes are the empanadas with an Ethiopian lentil stew gravy. And for dessert, some seasonal gelatin cups. Okay, I ran out of money. They're from when Hitchcock got his colonoscopy. Bon appétit. (Takes a seat)",Food
Happy Turkey Day.,Food
"The crust was charred, the cheese was stringy and flavorless, but the sauce. Oh, Marone, the sauce. Continue.",Food
Pizza? Please. This is a butternut squash and truffle butter flatbread.,Food
"Wow, that's a lot of yogurt.",Food
"I'm in a cabin in the middle of nowhere. Inside it's just me and that stupid, slimy defense attorney.",Insult / Snark
Don't make me hit you again.,Insult / Snark
"Stop saying ""insatiable.""",Insult / Snark
Why are you so obsessed with that game?,Insult / Snark
"I'm just gonna put you down, man.",Insult / Snark
"You get that hand near me again, you're gonna lose it.",Insult / Snark
Anyone over the age of six celebrating a birthday should go to hell.,Insult / Snark
Ugh. What do you even know about this person?,Insult / Snark
"Oh, now I'm gonna hit you for real.",Insult / Snark
"No. But it does say, ""Boyle believes obvious lie.""",Insult / Snark

"If you knew me, you'd know I hate surprise parties, so clearly you don't know me at all.",Insult / Snark
"Oh, look at that. ""Boyle saves Thanksgiving.""",Insult / Snark
Try me.,Insult / Snark
"It's so pleasant and boring. But, Holt, at your house, surrounded by these idiots? Guaranteed train wreck. Thanks for the invite. (Smiles)",Insult / Snark

"Do I? One of you is a criminal, and the other one is dressed like Steve Harvey. It's over. I'm ending this now. Sorry, Jake.",Insult / Snark
I'd love to see you date someone from work. Your head would explode.,Insult / Snark
Why stop there? Why not tell her you're an astronaut?,Insult / Snark
"Sarge, I don't need to be monitored all day long. I'm not a toddler. This is stupid.",Insult / Snark
"Dude, stop saying random facts to try to prove you know me.",Insult / Snark

You're not a genie.,Insult / Snark
"Why are you still playing with that stupid game, Sarge? The guy is dead.",Insult / Snark

"No, this will not be our Thanksgiving. All right, you all wait here. Give me an hour. Terry, to the door.",Personal Life
"Sarge, am I too heavy?",Personal Life
"I-I'm not done hanging out. Let's go to the bar, they serve food there. That's a great idea.",Personal Life
My wife takes the babies to the park all the time.,Personal Life
"Yeah. I had it on my desk, but I kept spilling coffee on it. Oops.",Personal Life
"I'm sorry, honey. I just didn't want you to worry.",Personal Life
"No! I have broad shoulders. I have narrow hips, but broad shoulders. God!",Personal Life
"Well, guess what. I can spoil your little game by sitting over here quietly all day and doing nothing. (Takes a seat and falls on floor) Oh! Aah!",Personal Life
"No, no, she punched me to prove Carlene wrong.",Personal Life
"I thought I told you. Remember when you were half asleep watching the news and the babies were quiet, and I said, real low, ""hey, baby. I'm back in the field. You want something to eat?"" And you were like, ""what?"" And I was like, ""you want something to eat?"" And you said, ""sure."" And I got you an oatmeal cookie? Remember?",Personal Life
"I like Turner & Hooch. Tom Hanks, reluctant friendship with a dog. That hits me where I live.",Personal Life
"Hey, baby. Happy you made it. Captain, I'd like you to meet my wife, Sharon.",Personal Life
He stared at me for 90 seconds while he ate an entire peach.,Personal Life
Captain reads my blast.,Personal Life
A little lower.,Personal Life
"Okay, okay, okay. Then it is settled. If Peralta loses, Santiago gets his car. If Santiago loses, she goes for a date in said car.",Personal Life
"Brian was adopted, so he has abandonment issues. Just struck out at tee-ball last week. Everyone called him ""cryin' Brian.""",Personal Life
He's a cute kid. Kinda looks like you. Handsome guy. Handsome little guy.,Personal Life
Seriously? The bet? They've been keeping score all year. It comes up all the time. What are you doing all day?,Personal Life
"But on the plus side, I think I know what to do with them.",Personal Life
"Well, now that I know you want me to say that, I'll just say it with two gobbles. Gobble, gobble... Gobble. God, it just sounds right that way. Ugh. I don't like this game.",Personal Life
"Hey, I'm not gonna be able to make dinner tonight.",Personal Life
"Baby, I've got some bad news. Someone painted a giant penis on our minivan. No, you cannot have an SUV now. Those things roll, baby. They roll!",Personal Life
"When you're that big, you buy anything that fits. A lot of fat guy clothes have racist overtones.",Personal Life
"Jake, it's been in my mouth.",Personal Life
"Uh, why do you wanna borrow the toothbrush?",Personal Life
"Yes. Let's all just count to a million. One, two, three, four, five, six... So then lceman says, ""You can be my wingman any day."" And then Maverick says...",Personal Life
I'm just glad I keep a toothbrush here.,Personal Life
I used a gift card for that!,Personal Life
Maybe he doesn't have any. Interesting fact about me... I once burnt my fingerprints off on a wok.,Personal Life
"Fine, what was with the flossing?",Personal Life
How long were we asleep?,Personal Life
"I mean, eventually... Not tonight. I need to go hug my baby girls. Excuse me.",Personal Life
I didn't know you went to catholic schooL,Personal Life
I get it. You're so mysterious and tough. But you know what I think? You're actually a big softy.,Personal Life
"You're the best, Jake.",Personal Life
"I need to eat 10,000 calories a day to maintain muscle mass. My wife made me all of this before she left town with the kids. That was everything in my fridge. (Closes fridge door)",Personal Life
"Oh, uh, you know, I-I haven't been to either place yet.",Personal Life
"Come on, Amy! Loosen up! You look like such a cop! Come on, have some fun, you know? It'll help you blend in! Whoo!",Personal Life
What provided our success.,Personal Life
I still want to know why you got kicked out of catholic school. Were you doing drugs?,Personal Life
Selling drugs?,Personal Life
How bad could it have been? Did you burn down a church?,Personal Life
"Well, guess what she said. Apparently, you were a model student and transferred of your own volition.",Personal Life
"I'm fine. And I filled this out. I just need you to... Permission to yawn, sir.",Personal Life
"No, all the things that you think are bad about Halloween are what make it great. The big kids egg you. Then you and your friends run away together. Friendships are forged in the crucible of Halloween adversity. That's all I wanted for us. You can keep the wig. I don't need it anymore.",Personal Life
I knew it! I knew you were a big softy.,Personal Life
I'm not tired. Why would you think I was tired?,Personal Life
"I ended up doing 25 minutes of sleep chin-ups on muscle memory alone. Tired Terry still gets after it, that's all I'm saying.",Personal Life
"Just long enough for me to squeeze in quick workout. So, like, three hours.",Personal Life
"Jake, you're the best.",Personal Life
"So great. We're having the best time. Right, Amy?",Personal Life
"Really? In High School, I played center field in the musical damn Yankees.",Personal Life
"No, man, it was before I got into the academy.",Personal Life
Francois Truffaut's Breathless. What? Terry likes foreign films.,Personal Life
"Hey, slump, you're about to get nailed by the Jake Hammer.",Personal Life
"The inside of your cheeks are very sensitive. It's like the inside of your thighs, except with a tongue.",Personal Life
"Oh, bird pooped on your shoulder. No, wait... Pooped on your head, then dripped onto your shoulder.",Personal Life
I'm Mario Batali.,Personal Life
This is takin' too long! I'm gonna miss the farmer's market!,Personal Life
I was working out and saw a muscle in my shoulder I'd never seen before. I thought it might've been a scientific discovery.,Personal Life
"No, not that. My brother-in-law is coming to have dinner with me on his way to JFK. But also the botched investigation, that's bad too.",Personal Life
"I'm telling you, it's good luck.",Personal Life
"I'm just saying, put a couple leather chairs in here.",Personal Life
"10,000 sit-ups.",Personal Life
Blammo! Jake Hammer strikes again.,Personal Life
"The Ebony Falcon needs to read Go, Dog, Go.",Personal Life
"Santiago, I know that you hate Halloween, but stick with me, and I promise you, you will love it.",Personal Life
Um...I'm building this dollhouse for my girls. It's their birthday tomorrow. I told my wife I'd get it done.,Personal Life
"Everything's great with my wife. It's just, my brother-in-law's in town, and we do not get along. He thinks I'm a weakling.",Personal Life
"Sir, this is not necessary. Also, can't sleep without my whale songs.",Personal Life
That's actually my wedding suit.,Personal Life
"Hey, Sarge. I assembled the castle for you. Here it is.",Personal Life
"Oh, my God. What happened to all the princess flourishes?",Personal Life
"Well, they were destroyed, so I turned it into a princess police station. You know, some jobs take brains, some jobs take muscles, some jobs take dainty little fingers. Did I ever tell you I had to wear a woman's wedding ring?",Personal Life
"You're a good dad. Don't put so much pressure on yourself. Oh, check this out. Working siren.",Personal Life
"Yes, Jake. I played linebacker at Syracuse.",Personal Life
"Yeah, but I was only 20.",Personal Life
"Actually, there was an incident after that.",Personal Life
Screaming shooting the piñata.,Personal Life
"Hey, excuse me. Can we please eat? My body is starting to digest itself. Terry needs nutrients.",Personal Life
What if we wrap his motorcycle in plastic wrap and melt it with a hair dryer? Little trick I learned in gift basket making class.,Personal Life
"Oh, I just want to see Lorelai happy, and shut up!",Personal Life
Absolutely. I just need to put my precious babies to bed with a story.,Personal Life
Fine. The reason I left catholic school was because I got into the American ballet academy. I was a classical dancer. And I was good.,Personal Life
"Fly to Montreal, hit a classy hotel bar, bone a stranger, slump over.",Personal Life
"I know you're not a toddler, because my toddlers know that ""stupid"" is a no-no word. Keep that Dozer-pad on you at all times.",Personal Life
"Yeah, that was my ex-wife's type too.",Personal Life
Don't apologize. I'd rather spend Thanksgiving at your house than with my sister.,Personal Life
"Point to your delts, Jake.",Personal Life
"Oh, I didn't tell you. I got kicked out of ballet school for beating the crap out of ballerinas.",Personal Life
Good call. Smart. I'll do it. I'll pick a better movie than Citizen Kane.,Personal Life
Cool. Where would I find a place that shows old movies?,Personal Life
They cost $8. You have a fur bedspread.,Personal Life
Gina is completely useless when Boyle is wearing lost-and-found clothes.,Personal Life
Sounds awful. Hit the park. That's a dog.,Personal Life
I remember that old bag. She was my favorite.,Personal Life
"Hell yeah, he does. Except now The Ebony Falcon is monogamous and too tired for sex, so his only indulgence is fresh fruit yogurt parfaits.",Personal Life
So what movie did you get us tickets to?,Personal Life
"Hey, that's mine. You took it from my desk.",Personal Life
Can't tell you how many nuns I wanted to beat up in catholic school. Ten.,Personal Life
I'm avoiding Boyle and his truth bombs.,Personal Life
She was right. She died two years later.,Personal Life
No. Robocop. It's got everything Ike--gratuitous violence.,Personal Life
So what are you doing tonight?,Personal Life
So what'd you think of Ropesburg?,Personal Life
Didn't graduate. Had to leave.,Personal Life
Cool! Awesome. There's a bunch of movie options. I'll probably just go with something classic like Citizen Kane.,Personal Life
Depends. How many g*ns do I still have hidden?,Personal Life
"Oh, my God, she doesn't even do that on airplanes.",Personal Life
"Uh, I have to go, too. My flight’s in... Oh boy. Eight hours. I can make it, I’ll just buy a sandwich on the plane.",Personal Life
"I thought about it, but then I put that thought on hold. I wanted to show you Ropesburg.",Personal Life
Charles isn't talking about his oldest arrest.,Personal Life
"I just want to apologize for my fellow detectives’ behavior. Okay, my granny also had the gift.",Personal Life
"Yeah, he's a little too serious. What do you think, Rosa?",Personal Life
We're not seeing a movie together.,Personal Life
We good. And for the record... If I could be any kind of vacation... I'd be lake trip.,Personal Life
Do I still have my knife? Nunchucks? Axe?,Personal Life
She once said the best comedy of all time was The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo.,Personal Life
Hey. People like the way that I look.,Personal Life
"So, what'd I miss? Tell me all the jokes. Everything funny that happened.",Personal Life
"Pedal, pedal, pedal, pedal, pedal, pedal, push. Pedal, pedal, pedal, pedal, pedal, push. All this cycling makes me feel like Lance Armstrong.",Personal Life
"He said that if the b*llet was a fraction of an inch to the left and two feet up, it woulda hit my brain.",Personal Life
You want me to go to a bar?,Personal Life
You are obviously trying to get me to go to a surprise party. Did Marcus put you up to this?,Personal Life
"So he goes to the lost and found, and he grabs something that's usually unflattering. That's when Gina gets involved.",Personal Life
"You look fine. Here, wear this. Jake, you need a jacket or something.",Personal Life
"You know, the doctor said that if the b*llet was two millimeters to the left and a foot higher, I might never have walked again.",Personal Life
It is coming out the bottom of my cast.,Personal Life
"So I'm able to do everything that I used to do. So now, if you'll excuse me, I'm going to go make myself a morning cup of coffee like I do every day.",Personal Life
"Nope, nope. Everything's under control. I picked up a couple reacher grabbers.",Personal Life
"Oh, none of my pants fit over my butt cast. Lucky for me my mom lent me her leg warmers.",Personal Life
"You know, I just want to let you guys know that I love you girls so, so much okay? So sleep tight. You know, daddy will never leave you, right, girls?",Personal Life
"Well, we just finished story time. I'm gonna kiss the girls night-night, then we can get down to business. All right, time for night-night, girls.",Personal Life
Sorry about the mess.,Personal Life
Boyle gets cold a lot because of what he calls his...,Personal Life
"I know, but I want to play it out. Do I still have my throwing stars?",Personal Life
"Yeah, it's way down there by my butt. Oh, yeah. Yeah, yeah, that's it.",Personal Life
I love getting to know people. It's my jam.,Personal Life
Amy broke everything and got us kicked out of the bar. Then we got attacked by rats. It's the best Thanksgiving ever.,Personal Life
So we can go see North by Northwest.,Personal Life
"Maybe it was too soon for me to come back. I would've just stayed at home, but I was getting lonely and bored. One day I looked out the window for four hours. I didn't see anything.",Personal Life
"Let me get that for you, Boyle.",Personal Life
"Oh, well, just to be safe, I bought tickets to all of them.",Personal Life
We are. Come on. We're taking you home.,Personal Life
I don't know why. I work out there all the time.,Personal Life
Oop. Found it. I'll be right back.,Personal Life
I didn't. Brooklyn Bulk Fitness.,Personal Life
Nothing. What about you... are doing tonight?,Personal Life
"He must have gotten it from the evidence locker or something. Don't worry. I had a backup plan. I distracted her with a mirror. She's like a cockatiel, sir... Fascinated by her own reflection.",Police Work
"We've done it, sir. If we stay on this pace, I think we'll finish on time.",Police Work
You gotta brief the C.O. first.,Police Work
"Gina, what are you doing in the Captain's chair?",Police Work
"No surprises from the coroner. A few gunshots, shoulder and chest.",Police Work
Good call. Smart. Keep it profesh.,Police Work
"Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, Ratko!",Police Work
What would you say is your biggest weakness as an employee?,Police Work
"Man, you were totally right about the cocaine, and you were also right about Rosa.",Police Work
I'm sorry about her. Okay. What's your experience with cyber-security?,Police Work
We need to soften up your look. My wife and Charles's mom donated some clothes.,Police Work
"That seems unlikely, but obviously he had a ton of health problems, so, you know, this seems pretty open and shut. Do me a favor and pull the surveillance tapes.",Police Work
Can you think of anything that may have caused Dozerman to be startled?,Police Work
She's dressed right. We coached her. She'll be okay.,Police Work
What happened in there?,Police Work
"Come on, Diaz.",Police Work
"Diaz, you did it. They found him guilty on all charges.",Police Work
Safe keeping?,Police Work
"Peralta, Dozerman says he wants to see you.",Police Work
Yeah. Okay. I'm gonna go ahead and schedule you for a psych eval.,Police Work
There's no need to be nervous.,Police Work
Briefing room. Five minutes.,Police Work
"Captain, here's the mope who hacked our computer system. His mother turned him in. His name is Corey Park.",Police Work
"His web handle is ""savant."" His people name is Corey Park.",Police Work
"Well done, sir. Welcome to the Nine-Nine. I'm Sergeant Terry Jeffords.",Police Work
Why are you giving candy to a baby in the first place? Don't give candy to a baby! They can't brush their teeth!,Police Work
I doubt I'll need Gina's help. I'm sure she's busy anyway.,Police Work
Buckle up. It's gonna be a hell of a ride.,Police Work
"Man, don't be hacking into my stuff.",Police Work
We got the letter.,Police Work
What letter?,Police Work
"Ah, you must be Simon Walker. Have a seat. It says here you were an I.T. Specialist with the board of ed for two years.",Police Work
Get a doctor!,Police Work
That punk who hacked us?,Police Work
"I may have a solution. We need to CompStat the office. What is CompStat? It's just using data to identify problem spots in the neighborhood. Now, I have been taking notes on points of friction in this office for years. The red areas are places where no work gets done. If we can fix these problems without anyone knowing what we're doing, we will finish on time.",Police Work
But how can we be sure he won't turn on us?,Police Work
We found the cocaine behind a green hamper. Never said “green” or the letter H.,Police Work
"Sorry, Santiago, I don’t have time for that. My psych evaluation is today. They’re gonna decide if I’m ready to go back on the streets.",Police Work
And what does The Ebony Falcon do?,Police Work
What is my name?,Police Work
Frisked! I frisked her butt!,Police Work
"Okay, this is Ethel Musterberg from the Prospect Heights Senior Center. There was an I.D. card in her back pocket.",Police Work
"You didn't have to hop in there, man. I can handle this. What's my name?",Police Work
"You blew our cover, man! Now I gotta go into an interrogation with no evidence and try to get Jacoby to rat out his distributors!",Police Work
Or did you compromise an investigation and piss off a superior officer?,Police Work
"Very cute, sir.",Police Work
"What are you doing, Peralta? You just blew my cover!",Police Work
I'm a Detective Sergeant in the NYPD. Holt told me. Why are you cutting me out of the operation?,Police Work
"Hey, Sarge, I need someone to fill out a lineup. Will you be Scary Terry?",Police Work
"Hey, Captain, we thought we'd get more work done in here, because...",Police Work
"Nothing happened. Jacoby wanted to do wind sprints outside. You know, he's a mean dude, but I think I'm making progress. He asked to borrow my squat belt, I told him no, he respected that.",Police Work
"Yup. A black Trent. One of many. Uh, what do you want to start with today?",Police Work
Nope. The longer we wait the more likely our cover gets blown. I'll make contact.,Police Work
You sure you can lift this much weight?,Police Work
"Listen, man, I know everybody's worried about me being psychologically ready for this. But I promise you I am. No matter what happens, no matter how many b*ll*ts are flying, I'm gonna be right there in the middle of everything. I got your back.",Police Work
"He means metaphorically. You know, saving him from all that paperwork. Paper cuts are a slow death, baby.",Police Work
So... What's the plan at the gym?,Police Work
"Look, baby, I'm sorry, but Captain's life was in danger. I just did what I had to do. It was an impulse decision.",Police Work
What are you guys talking about?,Police Work
"Boyle, pull it together.",Police Work
Hitchcock called himself Scully by accident.,Police Work
Stay down.,Police Work
You gonna talk to me now?,Police Work
Yes. The clothes hamper was green. The clothes hamper was green! Drinks on me.,Police Work
"Yeah, she did... Murder on lce, Recipe for Murder. Nancy was a wonderful Detective. I wanted to be her when I grew up.",Police Work
"It's going really well, sir. We've gone from 10 cases per hour to almost 20.",Police Work
"Oh, look at this. The drug dealer got a B.A. in art history from Brooklyn college. Interesting, huh?",Police Work
"Sir, call him The Vulture. Giving him a name makes him human.",Police Work
We call him The Vulture because he swoops in and solves cases that are almost solved and takes the credit for himself.,Police Work
"Well, it's surprising because you would think he had studied... drugs.",Police Work
But is this the same guy?,Police Work
"No... yes, I am. Yeah, oldest arrest... 68, like I said.",Police Work
"Hey, Diaz, I just need to make sure I've got the details right in this file.",Police Work
"Tell me, what room is just down the hall from her desk?",Police Work
"Any time Mt. Diaz erupts, everyone on the squad avoids her.",Police Work
"I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but your psychic friend's predictions about the drug case were wrong, which means all of her predictions are wrong.",Police Work
"Right, so you know about Rosa's anger incidents.",Police Work
You talking oldest bags? 68.,Police Work
There's only three files here. It's been an hour.,Police Work
"All right, let's get started. So we have good news, and we have bad news.",Police Work
Major crimes division just called. They're taking over your m*rder case. The Vulture is on his way here now.,Police Work
They're here.,Police Work
"Oh, no. The cabinets are blue.",Police Work
The psychic predicted the drugs would be found in something blue.,Police Work
Apartment's clear.,Police Work
All right. It's time to catch some bad guys. Its good to be back.,Police Work
"And if she's right about where we find the drugs, that means she's right about the other thing.",Police Work
What color was the hamper?,Police Work
"Okay, so I've already taken care of a few obvious problems. I moved the toaster to the break room, far away from Boyle.",Police Work
It's the perfect place for our second lesson... Courthouse wardrobe.,Police Work
"Enough. Look. Terry loves love, but Terry also loves maintaining a professional work environment. As your commanding officer, I am very disappointed in both of you.",Police Work
Or too fast.,Police Work
"They don't identify with you because you're not from the streets. I am. Follow, watch, learn. All right, listen up. I know you think you're badasses. But deep down, you're scared. How do I know? Because I've been that same scared kid, and if you don't get your crap together, I'm gonna end up busting you and throwing you in jail. Got it?",Police Work
There's no sign of anyone. You sure about this?,Police Work
"No, we do not. Something doesn't smell right to me.",Police Work
We got eyes on the bandit. He's a block away.,Police Work
That's it. I'm calling it.,Police Work
Hands on your head!,Police Work
He's gone. He ran.,Police Work
"I got a lot of work to do, Peralta.",Police Work
"No, it won't. Now get down on the floor.",Police Work
A minivan? A-ha!,Police Work
Hands behind your back! Hands behind your back!,Police Work
You don't have locks on your windows.,Police Work
We need an itemized list of everything that was stolen.,Police Work
Can you estimate the value of everything that was taken?,Police Work
None of the partials returned any matches. Nobody in your building saw anything. We've hit a wall.,Police Work
"Captain, we swept the scene, ran the prints, canvassed the building. We followed procedure.",Police Work
"Looks like the perp stole a computer, a watch, and a Jamon lberico ham, valued at... what! $6,000.",Police Work
I didn't do it for him. I did it 'cause it's my job. We cool?,Police Work
Fire! Fire! Fire!,Police Work
"Let's go look at those surveillance tapes, yeah?",Police Work
Don't blink too fast or too slow or too much or too little.,Police Work
We can't pull him over this close to the drop site. It'll alert the buyer. I say we follow him for a mile.,Police Work
"Guys, guys, it's not a handoff. He's leaving the package.",Police Work
"In this case, not being a cop might actually be better.",Police Work
"Hiding from me in the evidence room. They think I don't know, but Gina's been live tweeting the whole thing.",Police Work
"Yeah, guy was passing bad checks.",Police Work
"For exceptional acts of heroism or voluntary risk of personal safety. But, you know, six of one.",Police Work
"Good news is, the sting we set up to catch deadbeats went great.",Police Work
"Hey, Pembroke. What do you say we go talk about a case in the break room?",Police Work
"We installed a second lock on your front door, put locks on the windows by the fire escape, and set all your lights on timers.",Police Work
"Wait, tell us about the new Captain.",Police Work
"Yeah, the name here is the same name on the checks.",Police Work
I'm coming in.,Police Work
"My oldest collar was 78, but the PCP made her fight like she was 20.",Police Work
So all you know is what a bunch of other mopes have said over the years. Anything else?,Police Work
To be perfectly candid... My name is Detective Rosa Diaz.,Police Work
I caught Mr. Ladd physically beating his boss with a fax machine. Most of his cheek was caved in. His head was basically a blood fountain.,Police Work
How much time do we have?,Police Work
"You only get one shot at this, Peralta.",Police Work
"None of the partials match Whitman. If he did it, he didn't leave any prints.",Police Work
"To be perfectly candid, I was pretty sure it was the defendant.",Police Work
I think I know what happened.,Police Work
Your client instigated the fight. I'm certain. And I'm happy to tell you why.,Police Work
"Hey, if Jake says the guy did it, that usually means the guy did it.",Police Work
"The guy who did the safe in the second apartment, what was his name?",Police Work
Officer in the 92nd got the royal baby mugger. He had 19 wallets in his diaper.,Police Work
Here's an itemized list of everything taken from the garden apartment.,Police Work
"Number three, step forward and say the word ""worse.""",Police Work
"Number three, step forward and say, ""give me your money, you stupid bag of crap.""",Police Work
"You wanted this offer so badly, I thought I'd give you a chance at the job.",Police Work
"Hi, sergeant. No, I'm still not interested. At all. But this is Detective Santiago. She's one of our top detectives, and she really wants the job.",Police Work
You two have something to tell me?,Police Work
"Before we go any further, we need to know if you're for real. Describe the guy.",Police Work
"Come on, Peralta, Holt said to use the whole team. We all want this solved.",Police Work
"Yo, I looked at the photos of your victim on your desk.",Police Work
Yeah. He said he wants a deal. He has some information about some dude who steals Pontiacs.,Police Work
"So, if Boyle, Peralta, and the sergeant are out--",Police Work
"The puncture wounds are similar to a case I had a while back. They aren't from a knife. I think it's something spiral, like a corkscrew.",Police Work
"12 counts of identity theft, but I've been chasing him for a month.",Police Work
Uh-oh. You better get back here. Now.,Police Work
"On my count. One, two...",Police Work
"On third, right near here. How do you know that?",Police Work
She dumps it in the hallway trash chute on the way to the doorman.,Police Work
It's the one without any blood on it.,Police Work
"Stab! Then I... Toss the corkscrew out the window, and it lands on a passing car.",Police Work
"Okay, here's the first set of royal babies I rounded up. Popular costume. Any of these guys look familiar?",Police Work
That's because it was 98% solved.,Police Work
"They're getting nervous, Jake! They're getting nervous!",Police Work
Buh-buh-buh-back in the Nine-Nine.,Police Work
How about we focus on the murder and not the old person gunk?,Police Work
The boss is taking heat for something that's not even his fault. I can't let that happen.,Police Work
What are you doing? Holt said you didn't have to come in here. You don't come in on days you're supposed to work.,Police Work
We were running calls to pawn shops and then waiting for them to call back.,Police Work
Peralta! Now.,Police Work
You're everyone's secretary. That's literally your job.,Police Work
Why are you counting my shots? Are you trying to have me recertified?,Police Work
"Yeah, everybody does stances, Gina. Listen, uh... Hey, all right, all right! Look, hey, both you, just watch.",Police Work
"All right, look, hands here, stand up straight, chin forward.",Police Work
No! Gina! We've been over this.,Police Work
All right. Back your left foot up a hair.,Police Work
"JP, update on the Morgenthau murder?",Police Work
But don't stare at people.,Police Work
But don't blink too much.,Police Work
Peralta... Where are we on the Lincoln place murder?,Police Work
I think the bigger worry is slow blinks.,Police Work
I'm a Detective. I will detect!,Police Work
But it's not about you or how smart you are. It's about Captain Holt. The man's a genius. He's had your number at every turn.,Police Work
"Boyle, I need you in the briefing room.",Police Work
"In fact, the thing that you failed to see, Captain, teamwork, is exactly...",Police Work
Yeah. You gotta blink.,Police Work
And always make good eye contact.,Police Work
Good instinct!,Police Work
Don't call them morons.,Police Work
"All you need is for a jury to like you. If they like you, they'll trust you.",Police Work
This is an important case. You need to do well.,Police Work
"This seminar is not optional, Diaz. You're testifying in an aggravated assault case tomorrow. The D.A. is worried about how you present yourself on the stand.",Police Work
"He's right. You just need a win. Pick your easiest, no-brainer case, and work it till it's done.",Police Work
All right. Everyone's here. Today we're gonna work on our courtroom demeanor.,Police Work
"Jake, I have to say, the way you handled things with The Vulture yesterday was very mature.",Police Work
So this is my desk.,Police Work
"Okay, party's around the corner. Tipster said there'll be a huge amount of drug activity.",Police Work
"You wanted something, sir?",Police Work
"Ooh, when you were logging in the drugs, you missed some awesome stuff. Guy walked by in full astronaut costume, gave me a high five.",Police Work
"You got a second, Captain? I've got these overtime forms for you to s...",Police Work
"Well, Captain, it seems that Jake isn't the only person you underestima...",Police Work
"So you want me first through the door, sir?",Police Work
"But I'm too busy. I've got a special case I'm working on. Uh, Hitchcock, Boyle needs you to fill out a lineup.",Police Work
"Okay. Sit up straight, all right? Be aware of your hands, okay? And don't be afraid to smile. And if you need to buy time, you can always just say, ""to be perfectly candid...""",Police Work
The man is the real deal. You need to listen to him.,Police Work
"Now the good ones. Rosa Diaz. Tough, smart, hard to read, and really scary.",Police Work
"She and Peralta have some big bet over who gets more arrests this year. Ever since the bet, their numbers have gone way up.",Police Work
Jacob Peralta is my best detective. He likes putting away bad guys and he loves solving puzzles. The only puzzle he hasn't solved is how to grow up.,Police Work
"Uh-oh, Jake, firemen.",Police Work
"You're lucky, man. I wish I could get assigned here full-time. You could not be farther from the action.",Police Work
"You're wrong about Holt. That man has forgotten more about being a cop than you will ever know. In 1981, he caught the Disco Strangler.",Police Work
"Charles Boyle. He's a grinder. Not the most brilliant detective, but he works harder than anyone else. He's not physically… gifted.",Police Work
Can't. Firemen locked it down.,Police Work
"Okay, detectives, let's get started. Santiago, where are we with the Jay Street drug bust?",Police Work
Good. Take Boyle and Diaz.,Police Work
"Peralta, brief us on the vandalism case.",Police Work
"Amy Santiago. She's got seven brothers, so she's always trying to prove she's tough.",Police Work
"What are you doing, Peralta?",Police Work
"All right, let's get started. Scully. Where are you on digitizing the old case files?",Police Work
Dismissed.,Police Work
"Okay, I want you on this. It's gonna be priority one for the new C.O.",Police Work
Captain Holt will be here soon. He'll wanna introduce himself. Dismissed.,Police Work
"Why do we want to start a turf war with the fire department? I feel very uncomfortable saying this to you, but it doesn't seem like it's worth it... Unless you think it is.",Police Work
"Ooh, undercover work. I love it. I need more back story. First off, can it be my daughter's cat?",Police Work
"What's insane is how you refuse to get with the program. There is a new sheriff in town, Jake.",Police Work
Still hot.,Romance
The woman I-,Romance
"Hey, Rosa! Rosa. Rosa! Um, I just happened to notice that there's an old movie festival playing at the film forum this week. Wanna go?",Romance
So we’ve both decided that the healthy thing for me to do is move on.,Romance
A rose for Rosa.,Romance
"Hey, you wanna grab some dinner tonight?",Romance
"Yes, that woman.",Romance
All the girls were too big.,Romance
"Well, I am. But I’ve begun to feel like there is a small chance Rosa may not love me back.",Romance
"Oh, my boyfriend's coming too.",Romance
Hang on. I have a toast. (Stands up) I am thankful to have someone in my life who gives me a reason to get out of bed every morning. And I hope that my relationship with this person will only grow more intimate.,Romance
"For me: Cheap dinner, watch basketball, bone down.",Romance
"Hey, Gina. You know any scalpers? I wanna ask Rosa to go to the Rihanna concert with me, but it's sold out.",Romance
So what is this? Casual? Serious? I need to know how to make fun of you. You guys dating?,Romance
"Carlene was wrong, Gina. Rosa said it herself-- I’m in charge of my own destiny. That means she wants me to make a move.",Romance
"Yeah, you would. You'd be an evil mastermind, and everyone would call you the handsome bandit.",Romance
He keeps saying he wants to talk to me. I'm afraid he's gonna tell me he loves me or propose marriage or something.,Romance
Me too. But he's kind of hot.,Romance
Maybe he's having dinner with his sidepiece first.,Romance
"Okay, let's do this. I think you're sweet--",Romance
Man... Girls are so scary.,Romance
Why was your hand in her back pocket?,Romance
"Yeah, you did. Why don't you come back here and take me out to dinner?",Romance
Perfect! You look beautiful... ly... Appropriate for court.,Romance
"You know, some people might say that all the black leather kind of makes you looks like an evil villain. Not me. I think you look like a sexy motorcycle.",Romance
"You know how it is. When you have a chance to bed an older woman, you...",Romance
"She was, actually. That's how I met her. Went to college with her grandson Marvin. Don't... don't knock it till you try it. She had a replacement hip with some serious torque. It was like having sex with a transformer.",Romance
"That thing is a date magnet. I mean, how many girls have you made out with in that car? Six?",Romance
Is that Rosa? Tell her I said hi.,Romance
"Yeah, who cares about a kiss? Call me if you grab each other's asses. He's pulling over. It's going down.",Romance
The case of how you got so damn sexy.,Romance
I think he's into me.,Romance
Listen to me: the healthy thing for you to do is move on.,Romance
"Again- that’s sweet. But I’m not into you that way, and I have a boyfriend.",Romance
That’s nice. And I like you as a person. But I’m just not interested in you romantically.,Romance
Why don't you just go to the movies with me?,Romance
He dove in front of those b*ll*ts for me. I can't be mean to him. I watched him make coffee for 28 minutes this morning. But I also can't lead him on.,Romance
"What? You can hate people and still think they're hot. Case in point, Manuel Noriega.",Romance
"Yeah, she's thick.",Romance
Or slash his gorgeous throat.,Romance
"I think the perfect first date doesn't feel like a first date at all, because you've known each other for a few years, maybe even work together. And one night you're laughing, and then all of a sudden, it's just like blammo! Kissing.",Romance
"Fear is a powerful aphrodisiac. Anyway, he said he wants to speak to ""John or Jack Peralta or whatever.""",Romance
It's just... I want Rosa to like me.,Romance
