Charles,I think it was flan.,
Charles,"Hey, Gina. You know any scalpers? I wanna ask Rosa to go to the Rihanna concert with me, but it's sold out.",
Charles,Yeah. What's your second point?,
Charles,"Yeah, that was my ex-wife's type too.",
Charles,Cool. Where would I find a place that shows old movies?,
Charles,Great.,
Charles,Thank you.,
Charles,"Oh, man! My muffin. Ahh! Oh, my head! My muffin, my head! And I stepped on the... On my muffin! And my head and my muffin.",
Charles,"Hey, that's mine. You took it from my desk.",
Charles,Thanks!,
Charles,"Yeah, he's a little too serious. What do you think, Rosa?",
Charles,"Yeah, he seems cool. I agree.",
Charles,"Jamon lberico is an amazing cured ham from Spain. They had it at my uncle's funeral. I gorged myself at that funeral. I mean, I was constipated for three days.",
Charles,"Hey, Rosa! Rosa. Rosa! Um, I just happened to notice that there's an old movie festival playing at the film forum this week. Wanna go?",
Charles,Cool! Awesome. There's a bunch of movie options. I'll probably just go with something classic like Citizen Kane.,
Charles,Good call. Smart. I'll do it. I'll pick a better movie than Citizen Kane.,
Charles,"No surprises from the coroner. A few gunshots, shoulder and chest.",
Charles,Mm-hmm.,
Charles,Yep.,
Charles,Jamon lberico.,
Charles,Beneficio's might.,
Charles,You gotta brief the C.O. first.,
Charles,Great idea.,
Charles,"Oh! I'm Henry Morgenthau, owner of delicious and expensive hams. Don't I know you from the grocery store?",
Charles,On it!,
Charles,"Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, Ratko!",
Charles,That's a waste of manchego!,
Charles,"Oh, well, just to be safe, I bought tickets to all of them.",
Charles,"I don't know, I didn't wanna mess up. Because you're sort of... Opinionated.",
Charles,So we can go see North by Northwest.,
Charles,Good call. Smart. Keep it profesh.,
Charles,Why don't you just go to the movies with me?,
Charles,"Okay. Well, this is awkward.",
Charles,Stay down.,
Charles,Dream team.,
Charles,"Oh, look at this. The drug dealer got a B.A. in art history from Brooklyn college. Interesting, huh?",
Charles,"Well, it's surprising because you would think he had studied... drugs.",
Charles,"I just want to apologize for my fellow detectives’ behavior. Okay, my granny also had the gift.",
Charles,She was right. She died two years later.,
Charles,Rosa. Yes?,
Charles,Thank you.,
Charles,"Oh, no. The cabinets are blue.",
Charles,The psychic predicted the drugs would be found in something blue.,
Charles,She also made this really depressing prediction about my life.,
Charles,"And if she's right about where we find the drugs, that means she's right about the other thing.",
Charles,What color was the hamper?,
Charles,Yes. The clothes hamper was green. The clothes hamper was green! Drinks on me.,
Charles,"I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but your psychic friend's predictions about the drug case were wrong, which means all of her predictions are wrong.",
Charles,We found the cocaine behind a green hamper. Never said “green” or the letter H.,
Charles,Lady bin?,
Charles,Nothing. What about you... are doing tonight?,
Charles,"Man, you were totally right about the cocaine, and you were also right about Rosa.",
Charles,The woman I-,
Charles,"Yes, that woman.",
Charles,"Oh, my god.",
Charles,"I don’t know, man. I’m lost. The universe is a cruel and vexing puzzle. I-I’m at the whim of the cosmos.",
Charles,Choo. Yes.,
Charles,"Um, Carlene predicted if I get out of this chair, I’d get badly hurt, so I’m not chancing it. Oh, man. There’s no more pudding cups left. Ah! What’d you do that for?",
Charles,"Carlene was wrong, Gina. Rosa said it herself-- I’m in charge of my own destiny. That means she wants me to make a move.",
Charles,"No, no, she punched me to prove Carlene wrong.",
Charles,"I know, it’s crazy.",
Charles,"I like Turner & Hooch. Tom Hanks, reluctant friendship with a dog. That hits me where I live.",
Charles,"Well, we shall see what we shall see.",
Charles,Damn it! This is Jeffrey Dahmer's corduroys all over again.,
Charles,"Hey, Sarge, I need someone to fill out a lineup. Will you be Scary Terry?",
Charles,No one asked you to take your shirt off. Stop volunteering to take your shirt off.,
Charles,I'm- I'm not really her husband.,
Charles,"Okay, this is Ethel Musterberg from the Prospect Heights Senior Center. There was an I.D. card in her back pocket.",
Charles,Frisked! I frisked her butt!,
Charles,"Well, I haven't really been in a slump since my divorce. So I'd tell this person, ""Maybe get divorced."" He'd have to get married first.",
Charles,We're helping Jake's friend get out of his slump.,
Charles,I had the same exact one when I was a kid!,
Charles,"You want some help, big man?",
Charles,On the side of the turret-,
Charles,"Hey, slump, you're about to get nailed by the Jake Hammer.",
Charles,"No, you are not, Jake Rabbit.",
Charles,Apartment's clear.,
Charles,"Oh, bird pooped on your shoulder. No, wait... Pooped on your head, then dripped onto your shoulder.",
Charles,"I'm telling you, it's good luck.",
Charles,You could eat off his shirt.,
Charles,Man... Girls are so scary.,
Charles,"Could be a year. Could be a decade. Sorry, we're just saying bigger and bigger numbers.",
Charles,You okay?,
Charles,Hey. What's going on?,
Charles,So what you're saying is that this is kind of a...,
Charles,You know I will.,
Charles,"I'm just saying, put a couple leather chairs in here.",
Charles,They're here.,
Charles,No.,
Charles,Blammo! Jake Hammer strikes again.,
Charles,"Hey, Sarge. I assembled the castle for you. Here it is.",
Charles,"Well, they were destroyed, so I turned it into a princess police station. You know, some jobs take brains, some jobs take muscles, some jobs take dainty little fingers. Did I ever tell you I had to wear a woman's wedding ring?",
Charles,"You're a good dad. Don't put so much pressure on yourself. Oh, check this out. Working siren.",
Charles,You talking oldest bags? 68.,
Charles,"Yeah, but I was only 20.",
Charles,"No, man, it was before I got into the academy.",
Charles,"No... yes, I am. Yeah, oldest arrest... 68, like I said.",
Charles,"You know how it is. When you have a chance to bed an older woman, you...",
Charles,"She was, actually. That's how I met her. Went to college with her grandson Marvin. Don't... don't knock it till you try it. She had a replacement hip with some serious torque. It was like having sex with a transformer.",
Charles,"Really? In High School, I played center field in the musical damn Yankees.",
Charles,Nice.,
Charles,Yeah!,
Charles,I would never steal his thunder. I-I'd be afraid to borrow it.,
Charles,"Oh, boy.",
Charles,Come on!,
Charles,Is that Rosa? Tell her I said hi.,
Charles,What's up?,
Charles,"Yeah, I feel sexy.",
Charles,You know I do.,
Charles,We call him The Vulture because he swoops in and solves cases that are almost solved and takes the credit for himself.,
Charles,"Sir, call him The Vulture. Giving him a name makes him human.",
Charles,"Yeah, she did... Murder on lce, Recipe for Murder. Nancy was a wonderful Detective. I wanted to be her when I grew up.",
Charles,Yes.,
Charles,I used a gift card for that!,
Charles,I cannot figure you out.,
Charles,"What if you called him from a hospital and said his whole family is dead? Like, they died of cancer.",
Charles,What if we wrap his motorcycle in plastic wrap and melt it with a hair dryer? Little trick I learned in gift basket making class.,
Charles,You're welcome.,
Charles,Yeah! Winning by default!,
Charles,Come on!,
Charles,I love the bus!,
Charles,I'm always the victim. I don't want to be the victim.,
Charles,No. I'll be the victim. Don't make me a door again.,
Charles,Right.,
Charles,Wow!,
Charles,"No! I have broad shoulders. I have narrow hips, but broad shoulders. God!",
Charles,A little lower.,
Charles,Broad shoulders! Stuck! Told you... Broad shoulders.,
Charles,Voila!,
Charles,"Jake, I have to say, the way you handled things with The Vulture yesterday was very mature.",
Charles,Can't wait to see it.,
Charles,Yeah!,
Charles,I'm Mario Batali.,
Charles,"Santiago, I know that you hate Halloween, but stick with me, and I promise you, you will love it.",
Charles,"Yeah, you would. You'd be an evil mastermind, and everyone would call you the handsome bandit.",
Charles,"Okay, party's around the corner. Tipster said there'll be a huge amount of drug activity.",
Charles,"The department never washes them, so it's probably vomit. Hey! I got you a chocolate. Yet another great thing about Halloween... chocolate!",
Charles,"So great. We're having the best time. Right, Amy?",
Charles,"You're the best, Jake.",
Charles,"Jake, you're the best.",
Charles,"Come on, Amy! Loosen up! You look like such a cop! Come on, have some fun, you know? It'll help you blend in! Whoo!",
Charles,I'm backing it up.,
Charles,"Ooh, when you were logging in the drugs, you missed some awesome stuff. Guy walked by in full astronaut costume, gave me a high five.",
Charles,Wait... Hitchcock?,
Charles,What is happening?,
Charles,Really?,
Charles,You paid money to get out of working with me?,
Charles,"No, all the things that you think are bad about Halloween are what make it great. The big kids egg you. Then you and your friends run away together. Friendships are forged in the crucible of Halloween adversity. That's all I wanted for us. You can keep the wig. I don't need it anymore.",
Charles,"Well, Captain, it seems that Jake isn't the only person you underestima...",
Charles,"In fact, the thing that you failed to see, Captain, teamwork, is exactly...",
Charles,What provided our success.,
Charles,What is all this?,
Charles,I'm sorry I couldn't convince you to love Halloween.,
Charles,"'Stume! Oh, my God. It caught on.",
Charles,"Way to go, Jakey.",
Charles,"Oh, uh, you know, I-I haven't been to either place yet.",
Charles,(scoffs) Wouldn't you like to know?,
Charles,"What? (laughs nervously) That is not true, okay? I-I-I don't even like food.",
Charles,Who's Rosa? Y-you're the scared one.,
Charles,How long were we asleep?,
Charles,Kitchen buds.,
Charles,"I think the perfect first date doesn't feel like a first date at all, because you've known each other for a few years, maybe even work together. And one night you're laughing, and then all of a sudden, it's just like blammo! Kissing.",
Charles,So pretty much the same as what I said.,
Charles,Maybe he doesn't have any. Interesting fact about me... I once burnt my fingerprints off on a wok.,
Charles,What are you doing? Holt said you didn't have to come in here. You don't come in on days you're supposed to work.,
Charles,So fun.,
Charles,It's all right. 6 out of 12.,
Charles,"For the 12 components of food satisfaction: Salty, sweet, sour, bitter, umami, odor, sound...",
Charles,"Oh, wow. That's the best pie I ever had.",
Charles,We were running calls to pawn shops and then waiting for them to call back.,
Charles,I'm just glad I keep a toothbrush here.,
Charles,"Uh, why do you wanna borrow the toothbrush?",
Charles,"Jake, it's been in my mouth.",
Charles,You're everyone's secretary. That's literally your job.,
Charles,(sighs) I'm sorry about the whole pie blowup thing. You're right. The Flatbush Diner pie is awful.,
Charles,It's just... I want Rosa to like me.,
Charles,"Hey, Rosa, the Flatbush Diner's pie is terrible. It's inedible. Food is supposed to be edible.",
Charles,"Crust isn't any better. It's fancier, but it's all bells and whistles. Desserts don't need to be clever. They just need to be good. This is the best pie in New York City... Apple from Argos Bakery, founded 1910. Recipe unchanged. Taste it.",
Charles,"You just graduated pie school, bitches. Sorry I said ""bitches,"" I'm just really worked up.",
Charles,I have an idea...,
Charles,Nice. (Holding coffee),
Charles,That's the spirit!,
Charles,"Okay. Sit up straight, all right? Be aware of your hands, okay? And don't be afraid to smile. And if you need to buy time, you can always just say, ""to be perfectly candid...""",
Charles,But don't stare at people.,
Charles,But don't blink too much.,
Charles,I think the bigger worry is slow blinks.,
Charles,"You know, some people might say that all the black leather kind of makes you looks like an evil villain. Not me. I think you look like a sexy motorcycle.",
Charles,Yeah.,
Charles,So it's... perfect?,
Charles,That's actually my wedding suit.,
Charles,No.,
Charles,Perfect! You look beautiful... ly... Appropriate for court.,
Charles,This is not good. The lawyer is that slimeball grundhaven... Rosa hates him!,
Charles,Yes. You have to pull it together.,
Charles,"That's what sarge says to me when I'm nervous. Rosa, I think you're nervous.",
Charles,"But if the problem is that you're nervous, that's where Charles Boyle lives, baby. I can help! You just need to go to your happy place.",
Charles,She went to her happy place.,
Charles,Here she is.,
Charles,Yes!,
Charles,Your what friend now?,
Charles,"Yes, I did, and I am thrilled with the results. Although the jar is really hot.",
Charles,"Why do we want to start a turf war with the fire department? I feel very uncomfortable saying this to you, but it doesn't seem like it's worth it... Unless you think it is.",
Charles,"I'm sorry, Jake, Sal's is only the eighth-best. I put out a weekly Brooklyn pizza-ranking email blast. Sal's has the fourth-best texture, ninth-best crust, twelfth-best cheese, and honestly, they're only seventh in mouth-feel.",
Charles,"The inside of your cheeks are very sensitive. It's like the inside of your thighs, except with a tongue.",
Charles,"Uh-oh, Jake, firemen.",
Charles,"Mario is number ten overall in Brooklyn, and rising fast. He might've wanted to move up the ladder.",
Charles,Yeah.,
Charles,It'll be the perfect opportunity to update my rankings. Can we stop at home for a pizza bib?,
Charles,I'll just use my work bib.,
Charles,"In a word, yes. Amateurs go tasting, they fill up, and they lose their palate by the third slice. I take this very seriously.",
Charles,Gino... This pizza is much better than last time. You've always ranked dead last in structural integrity and sauce.,
Charles,Can't. Firemen locked it down.,
Charles,"Ooh, undercover work. I love it. I need more back story. First off, can it be my daughter's cat?",
Charles,"Fine. Let's talk about the cat. Short-hair, long-hair? Tabby?",
Charles,"Oh, that's brutal.",
Charles,"I like it. Hey, guys? Guys, I really need your help. My little boy, Brian, my angel, I bought him a short-haired calico after my wife fell into a coma... Motorcycle crash. And now the cat's stuck in a tree.",
Charles,He's a cute kid. Kinda looks like you. Handsome guy. Handsome little guy.,
Charles,"Brian was adopted, so he has abandonment issues. Just struck out at tee-ball last week. Everyone called him ""cryin' Brian.""",
Charles,"They're getting nervous, Jake! They're getting nervous!",
Charles,"Get off him, Boone! You big marshmallow!",
Charles,Well...,
Charles,Captain reads my blast.,
Charles,I'm coming in.,
Charles,Uh-huh. My turn?,
Charles,"The crust was charred, the cheese was stringy and flavorless, but the sauce. Oh, Marone, the sauce. Continue.",
Charles,Fire! Fire! Fire!,
Charles,Happy Turkey Day.,
Charles,What? What's going on?,
Charles,All the girls were too big.,
Charles,"Well, now that I know you want me to say that, I'll just say it with two gobbles. Gobble, gobble... Gobble. God, it just sounds right that way. Ugh. I don't like this game.",
Charles,"Come on, guys.",
Charles,"Well, guess what. I can spoil your little game by sitting over here quietly all day and doing nothing. (Takes a seat and falls on floor) Oh! Aah!",
Charles,That's a victory. That's a victory for Boyle. Boom!,
Charles,Pizza? Please. This is a butternut squash and truffle butter flatbread.,
Charles,"Wow, that's a lot of yogurt.",
Charles,"So this is your lunch for, like, the month?",
Charles,Hang on. I have a toast. (Stands up) I am thankful to have someone in my life who gives me a reason to get out of bed every morning. And I hope that my relationship with this person will only grow more intimate.,
Charles,"Um, Hitchcock.",
Charles,I'm a textbook people-pleaser. I have a serious problem. This was great though. You must be so proud.,
Charles,"I-I'm not done hanging out. Let's go to the bar, they serve food there. That's a great idea.",
Charles,Does it really say that?,
Charles,Damn it.,
Charles,"Tommy, can we order some food?",
Charles,Smart. Good call.,
Charles,There is nothing here.,
Charles,"Sarge, am I too heavy?",
Charles,"No, this will not be our Thanksgiving. All right, you all wait here. Give me an hour. Terry, to the door.",
Charles,"Yeah, totally. That makes sense. That makes sense.",
Charles,"It's a real culinary challenge. Give me 15 minutes, and then we feast.",
Charles,"You eat with your eyes, so the plating alone...",
Charles,"So this is kind of a play on your typical Thanksgiving dinner. For turkey, we have the Peking duck with a veggie samosa stuffing. The potatoes are the empanadas with an Ethiopian lentil stew gravy. And for dessert, some seasonal gelatin cups. Okay, I ran out of money. They're from when Hitchcock got his colonoscopy. Bon appétit. (Takes a seat)",
Charles,"So, you pretty much got the disaster night you were hoping for?",
Charles,That was perfect.,
Charles,I've gone 42 years without a lump of coal I’m not gonna start now.,
Charles,"Hit him in his fat, cherry cheeks!",
Charles,That’s right! Boom! I just kicked Santa in the testicles! ....Merry Christmas!,
Charles,"Hey, my flight is at eight tonight. It’s domestic. Do you think I’ll be safe if I get to the airport five hours early?",
Charles,"Well, I am. But I’ve begun to feel like there is a small chance Rosa may not love me back.",
Charles,"Hey, you wanna grab some dinner tonight?",
Charles,Coolio. He heads off.,
Charles,Whattaya say we grab a drink?,
Charles,Gotcha! Raincheck.,
Charles,A rose for Rosa.,
Charles,So we’ve both decided that the healthy thing for me to do is move on.,
Charles,"Thanks. You know, I kind of just realized--",
Charles,Gotcha. Raincheck on that convo.,
Charles,"Uh, I have to go, too. My flight’s in... Oh boy. Eight hours. I can make it, I’ll just buy a sandwich on the plane.",
Charles,Buh-buh-buh-back in the Nine-Nine.,
Charles,"Wow, is this all for me?",
Charles,"Oh, none of my pants fit over my butt cast. Lucky for me my mom lent me her leg warmers.",
Charles,"Yeah, I know. Check out these doughnuts. Whoo-hoo!",
Charles,"Nope, nope. Everything's under control. I picked up a couple reacher grabbers.",
Charles,"So I'm able to do everything that I used to do. So now, if you'll excuse me, I'm going to go make myself a morning cup of coffee like I do every day.",
Charles,"Okay, okay.",
Charles,"Okay, I guess. I mean, if you don't mind.",
Charles,No problem.,
Charles,Cold milk.,
Charles,It is coming out the bottom of my cast.,
Charles,"Backing up, guys.",
Charles,"You know, the doctor said that if the b*llet was two millimeters to the left and a foot higher, I might never have walked again.",
Charles,"Really? You're lifting the lifetime ban? I thought my lunch choices were ""horrifying adventures in diarrhea.""",
Charles,All right! I've been craving Sudanese all day. I'll print out some menus.,
Charles,"He said that if the b*llet was a fraction of an inch to the left and two feet up, it woulda hit my brain.",
Charles,"Pedal, pedal, pedal, pedal, pedal, pedal, push. Pedal, pedal, pedal, pedal, pedal, push. All this cycling makes me feel like Lance Armstrong.",
Charles,Wouldn't you like to know?,
Charles,"So, what'd I miss? Tell me all the jokes. Everything funny that happened.",
Charles,Great.,
Charles,"Yeah, it's way down there by my butt. Oh, yeah. Yeah, yeah, that's it.",
Charles,Yup.,
Charles,Right there.,
Charles,Oop. Found it. I'll be right back.,
Charles,"Hiding from me in the evidence room. They think I don't know, but Gina's been live tweeting the whole thing.",
Charles,"Maybe it was too soon for me to come back. I would've just stayed at home, but I was getting lonely and bored. One day I looked out the window for four hours. I didn't see anything.",
Charles,Ah...,
Charles,I know.,
Charles,"Oh, my butt!",
Charles,"For exceptional acts of heroism or voluntary risk of personal safety. But, you know, six of one.",
Charles,"That thing is a date magnet. I mean, how many girls have you made out with in that car? Six?",
Charles,"No, Jakey, no! That car is your superpower. Thor would never wager his hammer. Neil Patrick Harris would never wager his showmanship. Losing that car will be the worst thing in the world for you.",
Charles,Peanut butter will not be joining us.,
