Terry,"JP, update on the Morgenthau murder?",
Terry,How about we focus on the murder and not the old person gunk?,
Terry,"Okay, I want you on this. It's gonna be priority one for the new C.O.",
Terry,Captain Holt will be here soon. He'll wanna introduce himself. Dismissed.,
Terry,"Yes, sir.",
Terry,"Fatter, sir. They called me ""Terry tіttіеs."" Because I had large, uh...",
Terry,"A year ago, my wife and I had twin baby girls. Cagney and Lacey.",
Terry,"Ever since, I kinda got scared of getting hurt. Lost my edge. There was an incident in a department store.",
Terry,I’m fine. I'm fine.,
Terry,And I'm still not right.,
Terry,"Now the good ones. Rosa Diaz. Tough, smart, hard to read, and really scary.",
Terry,"Charles Boyle. He's a grinder. Not the most brilliant detective, but he works harder than anyone else. He's not physically… gifted.",
Terry,"Amy Santiago. She's got seven brothers, so she's always trying to prove she's tough.",
Terry,"She and Peralta have some big bet over who gets more arrests this year. Ever since the bet, their numbers have gone way up.",
Terry,Jacob Peralta is my best detective. He likes putting away bad guys and he loves solving puzzles. The only puzzle he hasn't solved is how to grow up.,
Terry,I’ve talked a lot about Jake in my departmentally mandated therapy sessions.,
Terry,"Absolutely, sir. Where do we start?",
Terry,"You're lucky, man. I wish I could get assigned here full-time. You could not be farther from the action.",
Terry,"You're wrong about Holt. That man has forgotten more about being a cop than you will ever know. In 1981, he caught the Disco Strangler.",
Terry,The man is the real deal. You need to listen to him.,
Terry,"Okay, detectives, let's get started. Santiago, where are we with the Jay Street drug bust?",
Terry,Good. Take Boyle and Diaz.,
Terry,"Peralta, brief us on the vandalism case.",
Terry,He can clearly spot 'em. You should take my minivan.,
Terry,You all got a problem with my minivan?,
Terry,"‘Cause my wife doesn't like it either. She wanted an SUV, but those things roll, man. They roll!",
Terry,You made a mixtape?,
Terry,"What's insane is how you refuse to get with the program. There is a new sheriff in town, Jake.",
Terry,Did he let you play your mixtape?,
Terry,"Get an iPod, man. Mixtape?",
Terry,"What are you doing, Peralta?",
Terry,What? There's a penis on my minivan?,
Terry,"Baby, I've got some bad news. Someone painted a giant penis on our minivan. No, you cannot have an SUV now. Those things roll, baby. They roll!",
Terry,Francois Truffaut's Breathless. What? Terry likes foreign films.,
Terry,"All right, let's get started. Scully. Where are you on digitizing the old case files?",
Terry,Why are you smiling? That's nothin’.,
Terry,Dismissed.,
Terry,"Oh, I love being Scary Terry. He says what regular Terry's thinking.",
Terry,This is takin' too long! I'm gonna miss the farmer's market!,
Terry,"But I'm too busy. I've got a special case I'm working on. Uh, Hitchcock, Boyle needs you to fill out a lineup.",
Terry,Why was your hand in her back pocket?,
Terry,"10,000 sit-ups.",
Terry,"He's right. You just need a win. Pick your easiest, no-brainer case, and work it till it's done.",
Terry,Don't make me hit you again.,
Terry,Um...I'm building this dollhouse for my girls. It's their birthday tomorrow. I told my wife I'd get it done.,
Terry,"No! I can do this. It's just driving me a little crazy. Where do I affix the princess tower, Boyle?! Where do I affix it?!",
Terry,"Not now, Boyle. Let a brother breathe. Let a brother breathe.",
Terry,"Oh, my God. What happened to all the princess flourishes?",
Terry,"Thank you, Boyle. I appreciate it.",
Terry,Peralta... Where are we on the Lincoln place murder?,
Terry,"Yes, Jake. I played linebacker at Syracuse.",
Terry,You mean drive you there and wait outside... Far away from the guns.,
Terry,"Sir, I haven't fired a weapon since the incident.",
Terry,"Actually, there was an incident after that.",
Terry,Screaming shooting the piñata.,
Terry,"Sir, I may not be the man for the job.",
Terry,All right. Back your left foot up a hair.,
Terry,No! Gina! We've been over this.,
Terry,"All right, look, hands here, stand up straight, chin forward.",
Terry,Gina!,
Terry,"Yeah, everybody does stances, Gina. Listen, uh... Hey, all right, all right! Look, hey, both you, just watch.",
Terry,Why are you counting my shots? Are you trying to have me recertified?,
Terry,I can't believe you tricked me!,
Terry,I just need a second.,
Terry,It's just the target looks exactly like a friend of mine. It's just freaking me out.,
Terry,"Yes. Let's all just count to a million. One, two, three, four, five, six... So then lceman says, ""You can be my wingman any day."" And then Maverick says...",
Terry,I know!,
Terry,Peralta! Now.,
Terry,"Shut it! Holt was right. I've been so worried about my own kids, I forgot about my stupid grown-up kids.",
Terry,"I should've been on you guys more. And starting now, I will be. But if you ever do this again, I swear I will crush your head in one hand.",
Terry,Try me.,
Terry,The boss is taking heat for something that's not even his fault. I can't let that happen.,
Terry,Sir? Thank you.,
Terry,"It's gonna be a long road, but I'm ready to get myself back in the game.",
Terry,"I mean, eventually... Not tonight. I need to go hug my baby girls. Excuse me.",
Terry,I didn't know you went to catholic schooL,
Terry,I get it. You're so mysterious and tough. But you know what I think? You're actually a big softy.,
Terry,You probably read a Maya Angelou poem at your graduation and cried.,
Terry,Why? What'd you do?,
Terry,"Oh, I'm gonna find out anyway.",
Terry,I'm a Detective. I will detect!,
Terry,"Look, Jake, I love you like you're one of my daughters.",
Terry,But it's not about you or how smart you are. It's about Captain Holt. The man's a genius. He's had your number at every turn.,
Terry,I still want to know why you got kicked out of catholic school. Were you doing drugs?,
Terry,Selling drugs?,
Terry,How bad could it have been? Did you burn down a church?,
Terry,"Well, guess what she said. Apparently, you were a model student and transferred of your own volition.",
Terry,I knew it! I knew you were a big softy.,
Terry,"Boyle, I need you in the briefing room.",
Terry,Damn!,
Terry,"Whoa, Detective Santiago.",
Terry,I'm not tired. Why would you think I was tired?,
Terry,"I ended up doing 25 minutes of sleep chin-ups on muscle memory alone. Tired Terry still gets after it, that's all I'm saying.",
Terry,"Just long enough for me to squeeze in quick workout. So, like, three hours.",
Terry,That's mine. It's a t-shirt from my fat phase.,
Terry,"When you're that big, you buy anything that fits. A lot of fat guy clothes have racist overtones.",
Terry,"You got a second, Captain? I've got these overtime forms for you to s...",
Terry,"No, sir.",
Terry,"I'm fine. And I filled this out. I just need you to... Permission to yawn, sir.",
Terry,What's this?,
Terry,I didn't ask what you were doing. I asked what you are doing.,
Terry,"That's unacceptable. If you wanna know which restaurant has better pies, you can't just have one guy try one pie from each place. Everybody needs to try all the pies from both places. We gonna be here awhile.",
Terry,Another one for Crust. It's not looking good for Flatbush Diner.,
Terry,Bring out the meringues.,
Terry,"You wanted something, sir?",
Terry,"Sir, this is not necessary. Also, can't sleep without my whale songs.",
Terry,"Everything's great with my wife. It's just, my brother-in-law's in town, and we do not get along. He thinks I'm a weakling.",
Terry,I can do it.,
Terry,He makes me feel so small.,
Terry,This is such a disaster.,
Terry,"No, not that. My brother-in-law is coming to have dinner with me on his way to JFK. But also the botched investigation, that's bad too.",
Terry,So this is my desk.,
Terry,"Actually, I don't like pickles that much.",
Terry,Oh?,
Terry,"So you want me first through the door, sir?",
Terry,"Hey, I'm not gonna be able to make dinner tonight.",
Terry,"Thank you, sir. I'll never forget it.",
Terry,All right. Everyone's here. Today we're gonna work on our courtroom demeanor.,
Terry,"This seminar is not optional, Diaz. You're testifying in an aggravated assault case tomorrow. The D.A. is worried about how you present yourself on the stand.",
Terry,This is an important case. You need to do well.,
Terry,"All you need is for a jury to like you. If they like you, they'll trust you.",
Terry,Don't call them morons.,
Terry,Good instinct!,
Terry,And always make good eye contact.,
Terry,Yeah. You gotta blink.,
Terry,Or too fast.,
Terry,Don't blink too fast or too slow or too much or too little.,
Terry,It's the perfect place for our second lesson... Courthouse wardrobe.,
Terry,"Boyle, pull it together.",
Terry,We need to soften up your look. My wife and Charles's mom donated some clothes.,
Terry,No.,
Terry,That's great.,
Terry,She's dressed right. We coached her. She'll be okay.,
Terry,We just assumed you were a terrifying human being with a short fuse.,
Terry,"I know that, Boyle.",
Terry,"Diaz, you did it. They found him guilty on all charges.",
Terry,Yeah. Okay. I'm gonna go ahead and schedule you for a psych eval.,
Terry,What are you talking about?,
Terry,I was working out and saw a muscle in my shoulder I'd never seen before. I thought it might've been a scientific discovery.,
Terry,"Captain, here's the mope who hacked our computer system. His mother turned him in. His name is Corey Park.",
Terry,"His web handle is ""savant."" His people name is Corey Park.",
Terry,Why are you giving candy to a baby in the first place? Don't give candy to a baby! They can't brush their teeth!,
Terry,I doubt I'll need Gina's help. I'm sure she's busy anyway.,
Terry,"Man, don't be hacking into my stuff.",
Terry,"Ah, you must be Simon Walker. Have a seat. It says here you were an I.T. Specialist with the board of ed for two years.",
Terry,I'm sorry about her. Okay. What's your experience with cyber-security?,
Terry,There's no need to be nervous.,
Terry,What would you say is your biggest weakness as an employee?,
Terry,"Fine, what about this guy?",
Terry,"Fine, what was with the flossing?",
Terry,That punk who hacked us?,
Terry,But how can we be sure he won't turn on us?,
Terry,"Savant, you're part of the nine-nine now. We look after each other. Hey, ball, if savant was to do anything to harm this precinct, would I destroy him? (Terry crushes the 8 ball with his hand, Charles eyes are widen) Answer uncertain. Try again.",
Terry,"Boyle says, ""Come on, guys."" That's two for Terry.",
Terry,"Damn it, Boyle. You left the fridge open. The door couldn't shut because of your empty pizza box.(Takes out the pizza box)",
Terry,"Everything's spoiled. My lunch is ruined. My chicken, my potatoes, my pasta, my meatballs, ham, my yogurt. (Takes out every meal)",
Terry,I love yogurt.,
Terry,"I need to eat 10,000 calories a day to maintain muscle mass. My wife made me all of this before she left town with the kids. That was everything in my fridge. (Closes fridge door)",
Terry,Scully.,
Terry,Where is it?,
Terry,Is it in your pockets?,
Terry,I'm gonna shake it out of your pockets. Turn around.,
Terry,Release your sweets.,
Terry,"Hey, excuse me. Can we please eat? My body is starting to digest itself. Terry needs nutrients.",
Terry,"No waiting, just toasting. I want you to toast. Now I wanna eat toast. Give me some toast!",
Terry,Why wouldn't you? They're both white powders. Of course they're interchangeable.,
Terry,Can't. I'm so stuffed.,
Terry,Toilet.,
Terry,I ate one string bean. It tasted like fish vomit. That was it for me.,
Terry,Do you have any more of these pretzels?,
Terry,But the cook is coming back.,
Terry,"Don't worry, guys, I found food. (Sets a box down and eat the packing peanuts)",
Terry,No. Where is it?,
Terry,There's a lot of food up there?,
Terry,You think?,
Terry,"I'm just gonna put you down, man.",
Terry,Make it five.,
Terry,"Nope, not doing that again. Move.",
Terry,"You get that hand near me again, you're gonna lose it.",
Terry,"Sorry, Santiago, I don’t have time for that. My psych evaluation is today. They’re gonna decide if I’m ready to go back on the streets.",
Terry,I think I’m ready. I’m no longer fixating on my fears.,
Terry,Okay. That sounds... fun.,
Terry,...I popped your pillow.,
Terry,"Ah... Hey, Charles, just take my coffee. It's fresh.",
Terry,"All right, you got it?",
Terry,"Absolutely. Hey, Boyle. You want to choose where we order lunch from today?",
Terry,But we'd love to hear it again.,
Terry,Oh... Yeah.,
Terry,"Gina, we've been looking all over for you. You can't just disappear and leave a sign on your desk that says, ""gone leavin'.""",
Terry,"Very cute, sir.",
Terry,"I'm sorry, sir, but that's impossible. With the twins learning how to walk, chaos reigns at the Jeffords household. I can't let those innocent pups into that madhouse. Terry won't do you like that.",
Terry,"That's cold, sir.",
Terry,Hitchcock called himself Scully by accident.,
Terry,"Hey, Captain, we thought we'd get more work done in here, because...",
Terry,"I was in the bathroom with him, sir. It was a nightmare.",
Terry,"But on the plus side, I think I know what to do with them.",
Terry,Seriously? The bet? They've been keeping score all year. It comes up all the time. What are you doing all day?,
Terry,"Okay, okay, okay. Then it is settled. If Peralta loses, Santiago gets his car. If Santiago loses, she goes for a date in said car.",
Terry,"Hey, baby. Happy you made it. Captain, I'd like you to meet my wife, Sharon.",
Terry,"He means metaphorically. You know, saving him from all that paperwork. Paper cuts are a slow death, baby.",
Terry,Nooo!,
Terry,"I thought I told you. Remember when you were half asleep watching the news and the babies were quiet, and I said, real low, ""hey, baby. I'm back in the field. You want something to eat?"" And you were like, ""what?"" And I was like, ""you want something to eat?"" And you said, ""sure."" And I got you an oatmeal cookie? Remember?",
Terry,"Oh, damn. She called me Terrance. I'm doomed.",
Terry,"Look, baby, I'm sorry, but Captain's life was in danger. I just did what I had to do. It was an impulse decision.",
Terry,"Now is not the time, Boyle.",
Terry,"I'm sorry, honey. I just didn't want you to worry.",
Terry,My wife takes the babies to the park all the time.,
Terry,How old is Kelly again?,
Terry,"I was born ready. And then I was not born ready for a while, but now I'm back to being born ready.",
Terry,"Let's talk strategy later tonight at my house. My wife's working late, I'm on daddy duty.",
Terry,Absolutely. I just need to put my precious babies to bed with a story.,
Terry,"The Ebony Falcon needs to read Go, Dog, Go.",
Terry,"You don't want to do this, man.",
Terry,It hurts you every time.,
Terry,Sorry about the mess.,
Terry,"Well, we just finished story time. I'm gonna kiss the girls night-night, then we can get down to business. All right, time for night-night, girls.",
Terry,"You know, I just want to let you guys know that I love you girls so, so much okay? So sleep tight. You know, daddy will never leave you, right, girls?",
Terry,What are you guys talking about?,
Terry,So... What's the plan at the gym?,
Terry,"Listen, man, I know everybody's worried about me being psychologically ready for this. But I promise you I am. No matter what happens, no matter how many b*ll*ts are flying, I'm gonna be right there in the middle of everything. I got your back.",
Terry,You sure you can lift this much weight?,
Terry,Nope. The longer we wait the more likely our cover gets blown. I'll make contact.,
Terry,"Yup. A black Trent. One of many. Uh, what do you want to start with today?",
Terry,"Nothing happened. Jacoby wanted to do wind sprints outside. You know, he's a mean dude, but I think I'm making progress. He asked to borrow my squat belt, I told him no, he respected that.",
Terry,'Sup?,
Terry,I didn't. Brooklyn Bulk Fitness.,
Terry,I don't know why. I work out there all the time.,
Terry,"What are you doing, Peralta? You just blew my cover!",
Terry,Or did you compromise an investigation and piss off a superior officer?,
Terry,"You blew our cover, man! Now I gotta go into an interrogation with no evidence and try to get Jacoby to rat out his distributors!",
Terry,"Point to your delts, Jake.",
Terry,"You didn't have to hop in there, man. I can handle this. What's my name?",
Terry,What is my name?,
Terry,And what does The Ebony Falcon do?,
Terry,"Hell yeah, he does. Except now The Ebony Falcon is monogamous and too tired for sex, so his only indulgence is fresh fruit yogurt parfaits.",
Terry,You lied to me!,
Terry,I'm a Detective Sergeant in the NYPD. Holt told me. Why are you cutting me out of the operation?,
Terry,You gonna talk to me now?,
Terry,"Oh, now I'm gonna hit you for real.",
Terry,Worried about what?,
Terry,Why didn't you just say something to me?,
Terry,"Yeah, I get it. It's been a rough year. But I've learned to embrace my fears. It makes me a better cop.",
Terry,We good. And for the record... If I could be any kind of vacation... I'd be lake trip.,
Terry,All right. It's time to catch some bad guys. Its good to be back.,
Terry,"You're a weird guy, Jake.",
Terry,I left one for you.,
Terry,Whoo!,
Terry,Major crimes division just called. They're taking over your m*rder case. The Vulture is on his way here now.,
Terry,"All right, let's get started. So we have good news, and we have bad news.",
Terry,There's only three files here. It's been an hour.,
Terry,"I may have a solution. We need to CompStat the office. What is CompStat? It's just using data to identify problem spots in the neighborhood. Now, I have been taking notes on points of friction in this office for years. The red areas are places where no work gets done. If we can fix these problems without anyone knowing what we're doing, we will finish on time.",
Terry,Yes.,
Terry,"Okay, so I've already taken care of a few obvious problems. I moved the toaster to the break room, far away from Boyle.",
Terry,"Right, so you know about Rosa's anger incidents.",
Terry,"Any time Mt. Diaz erupts, everyone on the squad avoids her.",
Terry,"Tell me, what room is just down the hall from her desk?",
Terry,"Hey, Diaz, I just need to make sure I've got the details right in this file.",
Terry,But is this the same guy?,
Terry,"Okay, all right, thank you, thank you.",
Terry,Got it.,
Terry,"It's going really well, sir. We've gone from 10 cases per hour to almost 20.",
Terry,Boyle gets cold a lot because of what he calls his...,
Terry,"So he goes to the lost and found, and he grabs something that's usually unflattering. That's when Gina gets involved.",
Terry,Gina is completely useless when Boyle is wearing lost-and-found clothes.,
Terry,"Already done, sir.",
Terry,Good lord. Where did he get that?,
Terry,"He must have gotten it from the evidence locker or something. Don't worry. I had a backup plan. I distracted her with a mirror. She's like a cockatiel, sir... Fascinated by her own reflection.",
Terry,"We've done it, sir. If we stay on this pace, I think we'll finish on time.",
Terry,"Sir, are you familiar with the story of Icarus? He didn't know when to quit. He flew too close to the sun, and his wax wings melted, and he died.",
Terry,Icarus.,
Terry,"Sir, I'm begging you, please, we have to stop. Boyle is still smoldering.",
Terry,"Gina, what are you doing in the Captain's chair?",
Terry,"Really? A tad, icarus?",
Terry,What's going on?,
Terry,"Look, she still has the bags of baby carrots I requested they put in. They're black now, but they're there.",
Terry,What in the world?,
Terry,What letter?,
Terry,"Oh, hell yeah.",
Terry,"Oh, my God, she doesn't even do that on airplanes.",
Terry,Nice job. What's the plan?,
Terry,We got the letter.,
Terry,Buckle up. It's gonna be a hell of a ride.,
Terry,Oh.,
Terry,What is going on?,
Terry,"Come on, guys. I know you're sad, but let's do our best to make a good first impression here.",
Terry,"Well done, sir. Welcome to the Nine-Nine. I'm Sergeant Terry Jeffords.",
Terry,Get a doctor!,
Terry,Briefing room. Five minutes.,
Terry,"So sorry, sir. That's terrible.",
Terry,"I know you're not a toddler, because my toddlers know that ""stupid"" is a no-no word. Keep that Dozer-pad on you at all times.",
Terry,Hey. People like the way that I look.,
Terry,"Peralta, Dozerman says he wants to see you.",
Terry,What's that noise?,
Terry,Safe keeping?,
Terry,"Come on, Diaz.",
Terry,What happened in there?,
Terry,Can you think of anything that may have caused Dozerman to be startled?,
Terry,"That seems unlikely, but obviously he had a ton of health problems, so, you know, this seems pretty open and shut. Do me a favor and pull the surveillance tapes.",
Terry,You two have something to tell me?,
Terry,"Enough. Look. Terry loves love, but Terry also loves maintaining a professional work environment. As your commanding officer, I am very disappointed in both of you.",
