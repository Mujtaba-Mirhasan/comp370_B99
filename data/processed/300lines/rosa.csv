Rosa,Maybe it was just old person gunk. You know how old people always have that gunk on them.,
Rosa,"Wait, tell us about the new Captain.",
Rosa,And go!,
Rosa,Tell me who has me for Secret Santa.,
Rosa,"Yes, you will.",
Rosa,He seems cool.,
Rosa,"Looks like the perp stole a computer, a watch, and a Jamon lberico ham, valued at... what! $6,000.",
Rosa,Sure.,
Rosa,Citizen Kane is terrible. Pick a good movie.,
Rosa,So what movie did you get us tickets to?,
Rosa,Just to be safe? What does that mean?,
Rosa,"You think I'm opinionated? Okay, here's an opinion for you. You're a bad judge of character and your shirt looks like vomit.",
Rosa,We're not seeing a movie together.,
Rosa,"Yeah, nice!",
Rosa,Here. I feel bad that you spent all that money on the movie tickets.,
Rosa,Nope.,
Rosa,It's not awkward. I like your company. You're sweet.,
Rosa,Hands behind your back! Hands behind your back!,
Rosa,A minivan? A-ha!,
Rosa,Babysitting. Ha-ha!,
Rosa,How's that interesting?,
Rosa,Also not interesting.,
Rosa,"Ugh. Really, Gina? A psychic?",
Rosa,"Thank you, Carlene. Your entire life is garbage.",
Rosa,You know what they don't teach you at the academy? It's better to be a criminal.,
Rosa,Where was it?,
Rosa,So what are you doing tonight?,
Rosa,Nothing.,
Rosa,"Don’t arrest him. Just smack him. Hard. With a phone book on a body part no one can see, you know what I’m saying?",
Rosa,"Ha, ha, I guess so, yeah. Why?",
Rosa,What’s up with the chair?,
Rosa,"There. Now you’re hurt in this chair. You can get hurt anywhere, Boyle. And if you do, it won’t be because some shoe salesman predicted it. You make your own destiny.",
Rosa,Move.,
Rosa,No. Robocop. It's got everything Ike--gratuitous violence.,
Rosa,I was. I'm done.,
Rosa,At least you get to sit on your butt all day.,
Rosa,What do you need?,
Rosa,That thing where we try to get a bunch of loser kids to become student snitches?,
Rosa,Losers.,
Rosa,Snitches. What about it?,
Rosa,Now I gotta read something?,
Rosa,You asked us to come in here.,
Rosa,"Fly to Montreal, hit a classy hotel bar, bone a stranger, slump over.",
Rosa,Yeah.,
Rosa,Yeah.,
Rosa,"Nah, I think I'm good.",
Rosa,"They don't identify with you because you're not from the streets. I am. Follow, watch, learn. All right, listen up. I know you think you're badasses. But deep down, you're scared. How do I know? Because I've been that same scared kid, and if you don't get your crap together, I'm gonna end up busting you and throwing you in jail. Got it?",
Rosa,What's happening?,
Rosa,That's never happened before. I don't like it.,
Rosa,"In this case, not being a cop might actually be better.",
Rosa,You did this program?,
Rosa,"My oldest collar was 78, but the PCP made her fight like she was 20.",
Rosa,Charles isn't talking about his oldest arrest.,
Rosa,"Come on, Peralta, Holt said to use the whole team. We all want this solved.",
Rosa,"Yo, I looked at the photos of your victim on your desk.",
Rosa,"The puncture wounds are similar to a case I had a while back. They aren't from a knife. I think it's something spiral, like a corkscrew.",
Rosa,Don't shush me. I'm helping you.,
Rosa,Uh-oh. You better get back here. Now.,
Rosa,That's because it was 98% solved.,
Rosa,Me too. But he's kind of hot.,
Rosa,"What? You can hate people and still think they're hot. Case in point, Manuel Noriega.",
Rosa,"Yeah, she's thick.",
Rosa,Sorry you got vultured. Happens to the best of us.,
Rosa,"On my count. One, two...",
Rosa,Or slash his gorgeous throat.,
Rosa,He seems like he would.,
Rosa,"On third, right near here. How do you know that?",
Rosa,What?,
Rosa,Hitchcock farts nonstop.,
Rosa,She dumps it in the hallway trash chute on the way to the doorman.,
Rosa,"Stab! Then I... Toss the corkscrew out the window, and it lands on a passing car.",
Rosa,Can't tell you how many nuns I wanted to beat up in catholic school. Ten.,
Rosa,Good. You shouldn't know it.,
Rosa,Didn't graduate. Had to leave.,
Rosa,Here's a hint. I'm not gonna tell you.,
Rosa,"If you wanted to make a bet with Holt, you shoulda made a bet you could win. Like who wears more denim jackets.",
Rosa,"Okay, here's the first set of royal babies I rounded up. Popular costume. Any of these guys look familiar?",
Rosa,"Number three, step forward and say, ""give me your money, you stupid bag of crap.""",
Rosa,Worse.,
Rosa,Worse.,
Rosa,"Number three, step forward and say the word ""worse.""",
Rosa,I remember that old bag. She was my favorite.,
Rosa,Fine. The reason I left catholic school was because I got into the American ballet academy. I was a classical dancer. And I was good.,
Rosa,"You tell anyone, I break your face. {ROSA CLOSES HER DRAWER WITH HER FOOT}",
Rosa,Officer in the 92nd got the royal baby mugger. He had 19 wallets in his diaper.,
Rosa,"Oh, I didn't tell you. I got kicked out of ballet school for beating the crap out of ballerinas.",
Rosa,What's up with this emergency meeting?,
Rosa,"Hey, is this why you were getting makeup tips from the prostitute in the holding cell?",
Rosa,"Hey, Gina, can you order food for us at the Flatbush Diner? They make the best pies in New York City.",
Rosa,Wrong. Ignorant and wrong.,
Rosa,"Boyle, you're always blogging on that foodie website. Which pie's better?",
Rosa,Morning.,
Rosa,You people already know too much about me.,
Rosa,Is that a nightgown?,
Rosa,"Hey, if Jake says the guy did it, that usually means the guy did it.",
Rosa,"No, I'm still furious at you.",
Rosa,Where's he taking you?,
Rosa,"For me: Cheap dinner, watch basketball, bone down.",
Rosa,"None of the partials match Whitman. If he did it, he didn't leave any prints.",
Rosa,"Pie taste test, it's over. I won.",
Rosa,"Ah, come on!",
Rosa,Good.,
Rosa,"So you were lying? What the hell, Boyle?",
Rosa,"Damn, it is amazing.",
Rosa,"You only get one shot at this, Peralta.",
Rosa,How much time do we have?,
Rosa,Why do you care so much about some old reporter?,
Rosa,No. And no one has ever thought that.,
Rosa,Pass.,
Rosa,Why? I'm fine on the stand.,
Rosa,I'm sorry... can you make her stop doing that weird thing with her face?,
Rosa,"And when this is over, I'm gonna find you, and I'm gonna break those little fingers.",
Rosa,Fine. I'll take your dumbass seminar.,
Rosa,Fine. How do I get these morons to like me?,
Rosa,To be perfectly candid... I like that.,
Rosa,I know how to blink.,
Rosa,Why are we meeting in the ladies' room?,
Rosa,What's wrong with the way I dress?,
Rosa,Your wife and Boyle's mom are both blind?,
Rosa,I look like arsenio.,
Rosa,No.,
Rosa,Yes.,
Rosa,To be perfectly candid... My name is Detective Rosa Diaz.,
Rosa,I caught Mr. Ladd physically beating his boss with a fax machine. Most of his cheek was caved in. His head was basically a blood fountain.,
Rosa,"Great advice, dummies. I look like a psycho up there!",
Rosa,That's not helping!,
Rosa,Of course I'm nervous! What did you think was the problem?,
Rosa,What's that? Sounds stupid.,
Rosa,Great! Now I'm starving!,
Rosa,"To be perfectly candid, I was pretty sure it was the defendant.",
Rosa,I think I know what happened.,
Rosa,Your client instigated the fight. I'm certain. And I'm happy to tell you why.,
Rosa,Huh. Boyle's advice worked.,
Rosa,"I'm in a cabin in the middle of nowhere. Inside it's just me and that stupid, slimy defense attorney.",
Rosa,"I owe you one, Boyle. Thank-you dinner. Tomorrow night. Gribaldi's. It's all-you-can-eat linguini.",
Rosa,"Oh, my boyfriend's coming too.",
Rosa,You're not a genie.,
Rosa,"The guy who did the safe in the second apartment, what was his name?",
Rosa,What?,
Rosa,"Yeah, I know how to spell cone.",
Rosa,Nope.,
Rosa,Nope.,
Rosa,You have a problem with me that you want to talk about?,
Rosa,Here's an itemized list of everything taken from the garden apartment.,
Rosa,"Oh, my God, enough.",
Rosa,"That's it. Get in my car, now. And if you say another word, I promise you, you will regret it.",
Rosa,"I thought about it, but then I put that thought on hold. I wanted to show you Ropesburg.",
Rosa,"You wanted this offer so badly, I thought I'd give you a chance at the job.",
Rosa,"Hi, sergeant. No, I'm still not interested. At all. But this is Detective Santiago. She's one of our top detectives, and she really wants the job.",
Rosa,"He quit to start a carpet cleaning business, because that was better than being Captain here because this is the most boring place on earth.",
Rosa,I'll pay for that.,
Rosa,So what'd you think of Ropesburg?,
Rosa,"It's whack, and you know it. Their number-one crime is tricycle theft. There's a bakery attached to the precinct. Come on, Santiago. You never would've taken that job, so why'd you even care that they offered it to me?",
Rosa,"Well, you're not the only girl at the table anymore. We work in a police force full of dudes. We gotta have each other's backs, okay?",
Rosa,"Yeah, I got your back. Don't smile. I'm still mad at you.",
Rosa,Moment's over. Shut up.,
Rosa,"Ha! ""Boyle objects to Boyle Bingo.""",
Rosa,It's the one without any blood on it.,
Rosa,"It looks like you live on the set of Murder, She Wrote.",
Rosa,Don't apologize. I'd rather spend Thanksgiving at your house than with my sister.,
Rosa,Yay.,
Rosa,"It's so pleasant and boring. But, Holt, at your house, surrounded by these idiots? Guaranteed train wreck. Thanks for the invite. (Smiles)",
Rosa,"Oh, look at that. ""Boyle saves Thanksgiving.""",
Rosa,"No. But it does say, ""Boyle believes obvious lie.""",
Rosa,Please do.,
Rosa,Are you eating packing peanuts?,
Rosa,Amy broke everything and got us kicked out of the bar. Then we got attacked by rats. It's the best Thanksgiving ever.,
Rosa,"""I marked them 'Awk' for 'Awkward'?""",
Rosa,What are you wearing?,
Rosa,"Yeah, till you made the best Thanksgiving meal I've ever had and ruined it.",
Rosa,That’s nice. And I like you as a person. But I’m just not interested in you romantically.,
Rosa,"Again- that’s sweet. But I’m not into you that way, and I have a boyfriend.",
Rosa,Listen to me: the healthy thing for you to do is move on.,
Rosa,You’re the only one who did that.,
Rosa,"So, if Boyle, Peralta, and the sergeant are out--",
Rosa,"Let me get that for you, Boyle.",
Rosa,I think he's into me.,
Rosa,"Fear is a powerful aphrodisiac. Anyway, he said he wants to speak to ""John or Jack Peralta or whatever.""",
Rosa,Yeah. He said he wants a deal. He has some information about some dude who steals Pontiacs.,
Rosa,"Yeah, I just said that. Chill, man.",
Rosa,Yeah.,
Rosa,"Before we go any further, we need to know if you're for real. Describe the guy.",
Rosa,So all you know is what a bunch of other mopes have said over the years. Anything else?,
Rosa,"12 counts of identity theft, but I've been chasing him for a month.",
Rosa,96,
Rosa,"1,000 push-ups, really?",
Rosa,Okay. I'm in.,
Rosa,"It's a pact we made. It really just means ""trust me."" And I do.",
Rosa,No way.,
Rosa,Why stop there? Why not tell her you're an astronaut?,
Rosa,"Fine. One false move, and I tase you in front of your mom.",
Rosa,I love getting to know people. It's my jam.,
Rosa,You guys having fun?,
Rosa,'Cause I'm not. His mom put this stupid braid in my hair.,
Rosa,"No, you look like a Boyz II Men Easter album.",
Rosa,There's no sign of anyone. You sure about this?,
Rosa,"No, we do not. Something doesn't smell right to me.",
Rosa,"Do I? One of you is a criminal, and the other one is dressed like Steve Harvey. It's over. I'm ending this now. Sorry, Jake.",
Rosa,"Yeah. 1,000 push-ups.",
Rosa,"What? That's not how this works. I said 1,000 push-ups, you have to back me up. That's the pact, end of story.",
Rosa,I hope you understand how serious this is to me.,
Rosa,Don't quote Die Hard.,
Rosa,We got eyes on the bandit. He's a block away.,
Rosa,What is he doing?,
Rosa,That's it. I'm calling it.,
Rosa,Hands on your head!,
Rosa,He's gone. He ran.,
Rosa,"Yeah, you did. Why don't you come back here and take me out to dinner?",
Rosa,"I got a lot of work to do, Peralta.",
Rosa,"No, you can't.",
Rosa,"I don't care about the push-ups, Jake. I care that you didn't honor our pact. I've always trusted you, and when you did that it made me feel like you don't trust me.",
Rosa,"No, it won't. Now get down on the floor.",
Rosa,I changed my mind.,
Rosa,"Night, Peralta.",
Rosa,"You said 2,000, remember?",
Rosa,What about your car?,
Rosa,"Sure, that sounds great.",
Rosa,His pain meds are making him weird.,
Rosa,I'm avoiding Boyle and his truth bombs.,
Rosa,He keeps saying he wants to talk to me. I'm afraid he's gonna tell me he loves me or propose marriage or something.,
Rosa,He dove in front of those b*ll*ts for me. I can't be mean to him. I watched him make coffee for 28 minutes this morning. But I also can't lead him on.,
Rosa,Oh. It's happening?,
Rosa,"Okay, let's do this. I think you're sweet--",
Rosa,Sounds awful. Hit the park. That's a dog.,
Rosa,You don't have locks on your windows.,
Rosa,They cost $8. You have a fur bedspread.,
Rosa,We need an itemized list of everything that was stolen.,
Rosa,Can't you just buy another knockoff?,
Rosa,Can you estimate the value of everything that was taken?,
Rosa,None of the partials returned any matches. Nobody in your building saw anything. We've hit a wall.,
Rosa,"Captain, we swept the scene, ran the prints, canvassed the building. We followed procedure.",
Rosa,What's the matter with you?,
Rosa,A P.I.? These guys are hacks.,
Rosa,"""Look up who Picasso is.""",
Rosa,She once said the best comedy of all time was The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo.,
Rosa,Depends. How many g*ns do I still have hidden?,
Rosa,Do I still have my knife? Nunchucks? Axe?,
Rosa,"I know, but I want to play it out. Do I still have my throwing stars?",
Rosa,You're here late.,
Rosa,We are. Come on. We're taking you home.,
Rosa,"We installed a second lock on your front door, put locks on the windows by the fire escape, and set all your lights on timers.",
Rosa,Ugh. You made us run up ten flights of stairs.,
Rosa,"Hey, Pembroke. What do you say we go talk about a case in the break room?",
Rosa,The case of how you got so damn sexy.,
Rosa,"Good news is, the sting we set up to catch deadbeats went great.",
Rosa,"You're not very bright, are you, Bill?",
Rosa,"It's my birthday. I hate birthdays. If you wish me a Happy Birthday, I will punch you.",
Rosa,"Yeah, guy was passing bad checks.",
Rosa,"Yeah, the name here is the same name on the checks.",
Rosa,"Extinguisher's empty, morons.",
Rosa,You think I have an anger problem? I don't. You are both dead to me.,
Rosa,I knew just where to punch it to get free food. Now I have to go back to punching Hitchcock.,
Rosa,Still too much.,
Rosa,Anyone over the age of six celebrating a birthday should go to hell.,
Rosa,Why are you so obsessed with that game?,
Rosa,"Stop saying ""insatiable.""",
Rosa,You want me to go to a bar?,
Rosa,You are obviously trying to get me to go to a surprise party. Did Marcus put you up to this?,
Rosa,Maybe he's having dinner with his sidepiece first.,
Rosa,"You look fine. Here, wear this. Jake, you need a jacket or something.",
Rosa,Who else is going?,
Rosa,"Don't lie to me, Boyle, or you will be eating your bone marrow custard through a straw.",
Rosa,- Charles! -,
Rosa,"If you knew me, you'd know I hate surprise parties, so clearly you don't know me at all.",
Rosa,"That will never happen. In fact, you just lost ""Rosa"" privileges. From now on, you can call me ""Diaz"" or ""Hey, you.""",
Rosa,"Yeah, who cares about a kiss? Call me if you grab each other's asses. He's pulling over. It's going down.",
Rosa,"Guys, guys, it's not a handoff. He's leaving the package.",
Rosa,We can't pull him over this close to the drop site. It'll alert the buyer. I say we follow him for a mile.,
Rosa,"Dude, stop saying random facts to try to prove you know me.",
Rosa,Enough! I'm going to the dumb party but only because I don't want to hurt Marcus. I'm still super mad at you.,
Rosa,"Oh, I just want to see Lorelai happy, and shut up!",
Rosa,"How's this? Oh, my God. It's so much worse than I imagined.",
Rosa,"All right, let's get this over with.",
Rosa,What's going on?,
Rosa,This is incredible.,
Rosa,"Thank you. But never call me ""Ro-ro"" again.",
Rosa,Wow.,
Rosa,What the hell are these?,
Rosa,"Sarge, I don't need to be monitored all day long. I'm not a toddler. This is stupid.",
Rosa,"Fine, but I am gonna play the hell out of some backgammon. Watch me.",
Rosa,I'd love to see you date someone from work. Your head would explode.,
Rosa,Mm. Sick burn.,
Rosa,I don't hear anything.,
Rosa,What? I put it up there for safe keeping.,
Rosa,"Yeah. I had it on my desk, but I kept spilling coffee on it. Oops.",
Rosa,So what is this? Casual? Serious? I need to know how to make fun of you. You guys dating?,
Rosa,"Oh, that's not good.",
Rosa,"So, Boyle…",
Rosa,"Let's go look at those surveillance tapes, yeah?",
Rosa,"Why are you still playing with that stupid game, Sarge? The guy is dead.",
Rosa,"His orders were stupid. I hated him more than any cop I've ever known. Whoa. I just realized I'm never gonna be able to say that to his face. I mean, I could say it to his wife at the funeral, but it won't be the same.",
Rosa,I didn't do it for him. I did it 'cause it's my job. We cool?,
Rosa,Good.,
Rosa,Still hot.,
Rosa,He stared at me for 90 seconds while he ate an entire peach.,
Rosa,"Really? 'Cause when you left, you made a pretty big deal of deleting us from your phone.",
Rosa,I don't think we're that dramatic.,
Rosa,Ugh. What do you even know about this person?,
Rosa,This is creepy and unlike you. You even know her first name?,
Rosa,"Well, this got upsetting real quick.",
